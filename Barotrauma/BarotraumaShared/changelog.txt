v0.9.10.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- Added 2 new moloch variants: Black Moloch and Moloch Pupa.
- Reworked Moloch.
- Overhauled level layouts and events (longer and more difficult levels).
- Added two new afflictions: medical items and poisons cause organ damage instead of internal damage and explosions cause deep tissue injuries. Both are functionally identical to internal damage, and treated with the same items. 
- Added DXT5 texture compression to reduce memory consumption. Slightly increases loading times; if you're not short on memory, you may want to disable the compression from the game settings.
- Added partial dismemberment for live creatures. Currently enabled only for non-humanoids. (Dismembering dead bodies was already in the game).
- Destructible shells/armor -> Moloch's shell can now be destroyed.
- Added a new monster AI state: Protect.
- Increased the threshold for limping and changed the calculations.
- Added limping for non-human characters.
- Modded servers show up as purple in the server list.
- Added 4 new background music tracks.
- Added parameter autocompletion to the "spawnsub" command.
- All content types except UI styles are now hotswappable.
- Made smoke detector logic more accurate (no size restrictions on the size of the fire, the fire doesn't have to be inside the same hull).
- Added "Output" and "FalseOutput" properties to smoke detector.
- Option to define ambient light values for individual hulls in the sub editor.
- Characters float in place instead of sinking when staying still underwater.
- Improvements to water flow forces: flowing water can push characters around much more heavily now.
- Balanced item prices and fabrication/deconstruction recipes.
- Balanced medical items.
- UI layout improvements when using an ultrawide resolution.
- Added "set_channel" input to wifi components.
- Added "power_value_out" and "load_value_out" outputs to reactor.
- Added search/filter boxes to content package list in the settings menu and item lists in the Workshop menu.
- Added submarine filter to the server lobby.
- Detonators are only triggered by non-zero signals.
- The state of toggleable controllers (= switches) can be set in the sub editor.
- Made toolboxes purchaseable.
- Added a warning to keep the drone door closed in Remora.
- All Thalamus cells die when the Thalamus dies.
- Removed "hold fire" option from the "operate weapon" order, display turrets on minimap as icons instead of text.
- Added some logic to prevent the game from modifying/deleting any vanilla content in any situation.
- Readded legacy Carrier (doesn't spawn naturally but can be spawned with console commands).
- Modified Typhon 2's coilgun rotation limits a bit so it isn't possible to hit the walls when firing at enemies near the airlock.
- Hulls can be multiedited in the sub editor.
- Placed down wires can now be re-equipped in the sub editor by double clicking a loose end.
- Added charging docks to Remora.
- Adjusted how pixel sizes are converted to meters (which are used to display the submarine's dimensions and distances on the navigation terminal). Previously 100 pixels corresponded to 1 meter, now it's 80px -> 1m, making the human characters about 1.75m tall. 
- Distance calculations on the navigation terminal take the shape of the path into account instead of just using the direct distance to the target.
- Made improvements to the manual order assignment by adding always visible name labels, displaying indicators for characters' current orders, and repositioning the nodes.
- Reduced the damage range of fires, characters don't take damage from fires if there's a closed door or a wall in between.
- Always draw steering indicators at the center of the display instead of the center of the sub. Fixes indicators getting offset (sometimes even outside the display) during docking.
- Added option to give all command perms with the "givecommandperm" command by using "all" as the parameter.
- Wrecks with no predefined Thalamus items can no more be infested by Thalamus. Allows to create wrecks that always spawn without Thalamus.
- The "shut down" reactor order now allows the bot to continue doing other things after powering off the reactor, instead of just standing next to the reactor.
- Removed the "initiative" skill -> all bots should now react better when there's something to do. Note: this doesn't mean that they always react on everything. It's just the end of individualism. At least for now.
- Reduced the physical forces applied on characters when they are hit by melee weapons, harpoons, or frag grenades. Adjusted stun for crowbar and harpoon.
- Disabled retreat/escape behavior for the bots when they take damage from items or explosions. They still escape/fight back when attacked by other characters.
- Refactor the medic priority calculations/logic: Bots should never treat others autonomously, unless they are medics or ordered to rescue. Bots should always give a high priority for treating themselves, unless there's a medic on board.
- Adjusted the flipping logic of non-humanoids to make them flip less frequently.
- Monsters won't anymore target nasonov artifact unless it is inside the player submarine or in the player inventory.

Modding:
- Made it possible to use repair tools with StatusEffect's UseItem.
- Made pressure deaths more moddable. Dying because of high pressure isn't hard-coded anymore, the characters are just given the barotrauma affliction which (by default) kills them.
- Added "HideConditionBar" property to items.
- Fixed wearables staying on the character when the item is removed by a status effect.
- Character light sprites can now deform. The cells of Thalamus (Leucocyte and Terminal cell) now use the deformable light sprites.
- Creature flipping parameters are now exposed. Adjusted the flipping for all creatures.
- Allow to define character joints as weld joints in addition of normal revolute joints. Weld joints don't rotate.
- Allow sound definitions to ignore the muffling effect.
- Exposed the "scatter" value and added new "offset" attribute for monster events.
- Added support for status effects in limb definitions (ragdoll file).
- Status effects defined in the character definition can now also target limbs.
- Added ActionType.OnSevered status effect for limbs.
- Creatures can now be set to disrupt sonar.
- Player attacks can now also use the conditionals (i.e. when player is controlling a character). Previously only the AI used the conditionals.
- Conditional sprites don't anymore require a texture definition.
- Conditional Sprites can now be non-exclusive -> Draw more than just one sprite at a time.
- Fixed conditional sprites not being able to target limbs.

Bugfixes:

- Fixed "Gaze in to the Abyss" achievement sometimes unlocking as soon as the round starts.
- Fixed characters sometimes being unable to exit the submarine when outside the borders of the level.
- Fixed ruin/wreck monsters not spawning if the submarine is too close to them.
- Fixed ruin items sometimes getting saved as a part of the main submarine in the campaign.
- Fixed rare "item with the same key has already been added" errors when starting a round (particularly when playing with a submarine with very large numbers of items/structures).
- Thalamus entities can't be selected in the sub editor when they're hidden.
- Fixed "spawnsub" console command not working.
- Fixed projectiles, welding tools and plasma cutters hitting destroyed Thalamus organs.
- Fixed reactor not shutting down if the turbine/fission rate are controlled via signals even the power switch is toggled off.
- Fixed reactor sliders not moving when they're controlled by signals.
- Fixed level triggers sometimes affecting entities that have left the trigger. The most noticeable effect was characters getting burn damage indefinitely after they've been close to a hydrothermal vent.
- Made flamers fire proof to prevents the flames from blowing up the fuel tank inside it.
- Don't allow harpoons to stick to very small limbs (such as mudraptor's "mouth tentacles"), because it lead to physics glitches.
- Fixed the husk infection crashing when turning the character, if either the non-husk or the husked variation has no inventory defined.
- Fixed characters getting weapon XP after using a turret, until someone else operates the same turret.
- Fixed characters being able to crouch when their pose is controlled by a controller (e.g. periscope, modded chair).
- Fixed bots being unable to aim correctly when operating a turret in another submarine (such as a remotely controlled coilgun in a shuttle).
- Fixed bots sometimes taking too much time to interrupt their current objective when the room they're in floods, causing them to get crushed by pressure.
- Fixed bots sometimes letting go of ladders too soon, preventing them from reaching certain areas (such as the upper platform in Berilia's cargo bay).
- Fixed multiple bots sometimes trying to treat the same person.
- Bots stop grabbing the character they're treating after they're done.

- Fixed chat-linked wifi components not working in multiplayer outside of combat missions.
- Fixed Azimuth using tutorial junction boxes instead of normal ones (the tutorial variants are indestructible and don't have signal connections).
- Fixed autopilot not being able to navigate past wrecks.
- More reliable syncing of door's breaking state. Fixes doors sometimes being impassable or impossible to repair client-side, particularly when joining mid-round.
- Fixed repairing doors getting interrupted at 50% when the door's collider is re-enabled and the character pushed out of the doorway.
- Fixed items getting used in the health interface when dropped on a subinventory slot in front of the interface.
- Fixed dedicated servers letting clients join with an invalid name when there's no server owner.

- Changed "creating hulls between docking ports failed" from errors to warnings. Allows creating exterior docking ports that aren't next to a hull without having the console pop up every time the port is used.
- Fixed changing resolution not updating character inventory slot sizes properly, causing invalid spacing in dead characters' inventories.
- Don't allow detaching signal components when rewiring is disabled or the item's connection panel is locked.
- Fixed misaligned hull next to Wreck1's airlock.
- Fixed "attempting to remove an already removed item" errors when mass-deleting items. Happened because removing items a wire is connected to removes the orphaned wires automatically.
- Fixed multi-part subs (example case: The Aeche III) getting teleported to oblivion when flipped.
- Fixes to bots getting stuck or killed for no apparent reason when the player is very far from them, due to the bots switching to a "simple physics mode" which prevents them from doing certain kinds of interactions.
- The explosive cargo mission that places a block of Volatile Compound N in one of the crates no longer requires delivering the volatile block to the destination.
- Disabled crush depth in the submarine test mode.
- Fixed monsters staying invisible if they die far away from the camera view.

- Allow subs to be saved to subdirectories of the "Submarines" folder (e.g. "Submarines/Downloaded").
- Fixed a couple of waypoints in Berilia that prevented bots from using the ladders.
- Fixed Husked Crawler bleeding red blood.
- Fixed the priority of the operate order being 69 when it should be 70, which sometimes caused bots to get stuck between two objectives (like repairing or fixing leaks).
- Fixed enemies always using the priority defined for "room" when they should use the priority for "sonar".
- Fixed monsters not being able to drop down from platforms/hatches etc. In practice they still have difficulties in getting down from the hatches when they don't swim because they are so big.
- Fixed bots ignoring themselves as a target when they are rescuing others.
- Fixed numerous issues in the monster behavior when simple physics is enabled. e.g. Ignoring targets or not being able to attack or eat them.
- Fixed hitting damage modifiers emitting a ridiculous amount of particles.
- Fixed some cases where bots fail to open the door that they should be able to open (because they skipped a waypoint without checking the doors).
- Fixed monsters not keeping inside the level.
- Fixed a crash when the command interface button was pressed while the player is controlling a custom monster that didn't have character info but was able to speak.
- Fixed monsters sometimes ignoring their target after attacking.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed bots being unable to fire turrets due to the visibility raycast hitting the turret's collider.
- Fixed submarine's version number resetting to 0.0.0.0 when saving in the sub editor (didn't affect the actual saved sub file, only the in-game metadata that got fixed by restarting the game - so there's no need to do anything to fix the sub files you saved with the previous version).
- Fixed server list occasionally crashing when trying to filter based on game mode.
- Fixed an issue in multiplayer campaign that occasionally caused clients to get kicked with a "missing entity" error message.
- Fixed clients occasionally crashing when joining a server mid-round. Happened when the client tried to execute the attack of a monster that has already despawned server-side.
- Fixed local changes an user has made to a mod getting overwritten when the item gets autoupdated.
- Changed the hotkey to toggle the entity list in the sub editor from Q to the "toggle inventory" keybind to make it a little more user-friendly on AZERTY keyboards.
- Fixed corpses in wrecks being considered dead members of the crew in SteamAchievementManager, preventing "lone sailor" from unlocking and making it possible to unlock "last man standing" with just one character.

- Fixed terminals not sending any outputs server-side.
- Fixed bots unequipping diving suits when they shouldn't. Only happened while doing a low prio objective.
- Fixed retreating bots attacking with adhoc weapons like tools. If the bots retreat, they shouldn't use weapons at all.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.7.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed crashing when attempting to publish Workshop items.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.7.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UI/UX improvements:
- Graphical and functional overhaul of all user interfaces.
- Cursor changes according to what it's hovered on (hand icon when on a button, caret icon when on a textbox, etc).
- New loading screen.
- Better feedback on shooting.
- Double clicking on an item moves it to the equipped inventory (e.g. ammo to the equipped weapon).
- Periscopes can be deselected by pressing esc.
- Fabricators can pull ingredients directly from the user's inventory without having to place them in the fabricator's input slots.
- Lock the on/off switch in the pump interface when the state is controlled by signals, same with the engine slider.
- 1 second cooldown before doors can be opened/closed after someone else has opened/closed them. Makes it less likely for doors to be opened/closed accidentally when multiple people are trying to use them at the same time. 
- Show a warning if trying to start a campaign for the first time without playing the tutorials.
- Diving suits and fire extinguishers are not automatically picked up from the lockers/brackets when clicking on them to make it less likely to accidentally pick them up. Instead, clicking on them opens the inventory of the container, the same way when interacting with e.g. a steel cabinet.
- Subinventories (= inventories inside items, toolboxes for example) open/close faster and cannot be interacted with until fully open.
- Contents of toolboxes and crates are shown in the tooltip when hovering the cursor over the slot.
- In-game message boxes (mission/traitor notifications) close automatically after 15 seconds if not interacted with.
- Right-clicking in the sub editor opens a context menu that can be used to remove, cut, copy and paste entities (making it possible to remove them when using a keyboard that doesn't have a delete key).
- Hide cursor when aiming with a turret or a ranged weapon.
- Hide inventory when operating a turret.
- Added filtering to sprite and particle editors.
- Added a "Decorative" category to the submarine editor.
- Made docking indicators more visible on the sonar.
- Show mic input level also when Push-to-Talk mode is selected to make it easier to adjust the level without having to switch the mode to Voice Activity.
- Pressing the up arrow brings up previously sent chat messages, making it easier to resend them.
- The filter in the sub editor only searches from the currently selected category.

Optimizations:
- Major physics optimization. Most importantly, the physics are now multithreaded, making the game perform much better when there are large numbers of characters active.
- Item optimizations. Items that don't currently have any components active are not updated, which significantly improves the performance especially in large subs with lots of items.
- More aggressive character culling (characters stop being rendered as soon as they exit the camera view).
- Dead bodies despawn after a few minutes (or when the character respawns in multiplayer). The despawning character's items are placed in a duffel bag and dropped near the body. Prevents performance issues when lots of bodies start to accumulate in the submarine.
- Preload necessary monster assets at the start of the round to prevent lag spikes when a monster spawns.
- Fixed serious performance issues when creatures are on the borders of the sub (some issues still remain).
- Improved the performance of human AI (bots).

Additions and changes:
- Added Korean translation.
- Added an improved version of Typhon.
- Reworked Berilia.
- New shuttle, "Hemulen".
- Merged Selkie and Bunyip into a new, improved shuttle (just called Selkie now).
- Increased level sizes.
- Rebalanced monster spawns.
- Balanced skill levels and skill gains.
- Skill gain values are now moddable (see Content/SkillSettings.xml).
- Added a few new artifact missions.
- The job gear variants are not just visually different versions of the same item, but completely separate items. The job variants now allow the players to choose what kind of gear they want to spawn with, not just the look of the uniform.
- Attachable items and wire nodes can now be freely placed around the character instead of always being placed at the position of the character. When attaching items/wires, there's a placement grid that makes it much easier to neatly attach/wire things mid-round.
- The submarines now get automatically outfitted with a semi-random selection of supplies when starting a campaign. The items that have been manually placed in the submarine editor are kept as-is.
- Split internal damage into multiple subtypes: blunt force trauma, lacerations and bite wounds. The new afflictions are functionally identical to the default internal damage affliction, but can be used to identify the source of the injuries.
- Humans are more resistant to gunshot wounds, lacerations and blunt force trauma than monsters. The intention is to allow making weapons more effective towards monsters without making killing your crewmates with them too easy.
- Added a "terminal" item that can be used to send and display textual signals. Could be used for things such as terminals that send commands to devices or display some data received from devices.
- Added muzzle flashes to small firearms.
- Added a crosshair when aiming with small firearms. The crosshair also indicates the spread of the weapon.
- Increased the skill requirements to operate the reactor.
- New background music for editors.
- Characters with an insufficient electrical engineering skill may get electrocuted when rewiring powered devices.
- Added holes in the level walls next to the outpost at the end of the level, so the player doesn't have to backtrack through most of the level if they approach the outpost from the wrong side of the level wall.
- Added heavy water currents at the sides of the level to make it more obvious that you're not supposed to go that way.
- Added subtle chromatic aberration & blur when suffering from heavy bloodloss.
- Nerfed hull damage from plasma cutter and welding tool explosions.
- Removed repair thresholds from items; any device that's not in perfect condition can now be repaired.
- Rebalanced medical items: stat-boosting effects last much longer.
- Modified vigor buffs from steroids and hyperzine to be intantaneous instead of delayed.
- Tweaked opiates. They now do less overdose damage, produce a lower addiction for skilled users, but produce a serious addiction for unskilled users.
- Bandages now have 3 uses.
- Removed oxygenite shards as a product of deconstructing liquid oxygenite to prevent production loops.
- Screwdrivers can be used as shivs!
- Fuel rods now always return their steel on deconstruction.
- Constructing fuel rods now requires lead.
- Mouse button names are now translated.
- Improved tiger thresher texture and lights.
- Replaced the legacy ladder, stair and docking port sprites.
- New alarm buzzer sprite that actually looks like an alarm buzzer.
- New (smaller) small pump sprite.
- Decreased the range and brightness of the "halo" around the players.
- Exposed pump's MaxFlow parameter in the sub editor.
- Added a lot more oomph to nuclear explosions.
- Added damage particle effects that are rendered on top of the characters (also under water).
- Split internal damage into categories: gunshot wound, blunt trauma, lacerations, monster bites, and internal damage.
- Gunshot wound is no longer a bleeding affliction.
- Humans are more resistant to damage caused by weapons (means we can increase the damage on monsters without making the weapons too lethal on humans)
- Added damage protections on some clothes.
- Major SMG buff: larger magazine, less spread, more damage, but slightly lower fire rate.
- Minor Shotgun buff: more damage and stun.
- Slightly decreased the stun effect from revolver ammunition.
- Modding: Removed all texture paths from limbs where they are not required. Fixes issues when trying to create a copy with a custom texture based on an existing character. Note that the "Copy Character" functionality does not automatically replace texture paths that have been defined in limbs, because that could lead into issues. If there are texture paths in the limbs, you'll have to handle it manually. The texture paths defined in limbs are limb specific overrides to the common path defined in the ragdoll's properties.
- Use "weldingequipment" tag instead of "weldingtool" identifier when seeking the equipment for fixing the leaks to enable support for custom welding equipment.
- Use "cuttingequipment" tag instead of "plasmacutter" identifier as required items for collecting minerals to enable support for custom cutting equipment.
- Artifact mission markers are shown on the sonar even after the artifact is on board to make it harder to lose the artifact.
- Made monster mission markers more imprecise.
- Made the "name contains illegal symbols" error message more descriptive (with instructions to change the name to something else).
- CPR damage can be modded by editing the affliction xml.
- A warning when attempting to start a campaign that was saved with different mods than the ones that are currently active.
- Switched from .NET Framework 4.5/Mono to .NET Core 3.0:
	- Improves general stability, especially on macOS and Linux.
	- Lowers number of dependencies, simplifying the installation process.
	- Introduces features that will translate into further stability and performance improvements in the future.
- Switched from MP4 to WebM to minimize bloat and dependencies on patented tech.
- Cap the framerate to 200 FPS when VSync is off to prevent overloading the GPU. The cap can be adjusted by changing the "framelimit" attribute in config_player.xml.
- Wifi components in the respawn shuttle can't communicate with components in other submarines/shuttles.
- Power consumption of damaged devices doesn't increase as much anymore.
- Made tonic liquid purchasable.
- Added combat priorities to alien weapons to allow bots to use them.
- Improved name tag hiding.
- Give job items to humans spawned with the "spawn" command.
- Slightly increased the view range of the coilguns and railguns.
- Continue playing the main menu and editor music from the previous position instead of restarting when switching between screens.
- Marked "editsubs" a cheat command (so you can't just switch to the sub editor, spawn whatever you need and go back to the game without enabling cheats).

AI:
- Bots can now undock the sub.
- Humanoids now use the "group" property like non-humanoids. This allows non-humanoid creatures to be treated as friendly/neutral subjects by the bots.
- Replaced the generic "cannot reach target" messages with context-specific and more descriptive messages.
- Bots now take the other bots into account when they evaluate the importance of the tasks. Fixes multiple bots going to fix the same leaks or repair the same items.
- Bots should now abandon the combat objective only when not fleeing from an enemy. If they fail to flee from an enemy, they will fight (or avoid) instead.
- Fixed bots loading the turrets only with the default ammunition. 
- Fixed multiple bots trying to navigate the submarine at the same time.
- Fixed pathfinding applying 10x more penalty on vertical distance when the host is outside (should only apply inside).
- Fixed bots starting the path from obstructed waypoints or waypoints that are inside when they are outside or vice versa.
- Fixed issues when bots are trying to enter the airlock from outside.
- Fixed bots getting stuck in the combat mode (with 100 priority) when they try to retreat to a target that cannot be reached.
- Fixed two-handed items like ammoboxes not being visible when the bots carry them.
- Fixed issues when the bots try to equip items or contain them inside other items.
- Fixed bots sometimes going to repair leaks/fix things without a mask or a suit.
- Fixed bots being unable to put diving suits into lockers when there already is a diving suit in the targeted container. Instead of dropping it on the ground, the bots now try to find a new place for the suit before abandoning the objective.
- Fixed bots seeking paths through doors when they have a crowbar/wrench equipped.
- Fixed bots sometimes being unable to put off fires and dying while trying to do it (because of a failing raycast).
- Fixed bots not shooting hostile submarines.

Monsters:
- New behaviors: avoiding, passive-aggressive, and aggressive.
- Adjusted Bonethresher, added a berserker attack when the creature is low in health.
- Revised Matriarch's behavior: Matriarchs now spawn in swarms, protected by other Hammerheads, and they try to keep the distance to the submarine. Boosted the explosion and increased the Spawn count.
- Added new missions about Hammerhead Matriarch.
- Revised all the creatures using the new behaviors.
- Changed how "attack when provoked" works. The previous state is now reset when the target changes. Also fixed several relate issues. Rename the property (requires action if custom characters use it). When a creature is attacked and "attack when provoked" is false and the attacker is not found in the predefined ai targets, the creature flees by default instead of just ignoring the attacker.
- Refactored the eating behavior: fixes small creatures not being able to eat significantly larger creatures.
- Adjusted the commonness and the reward of the Thresher swarm mission.
- Improved the indoors escaping behavior.
- Reduced the linear velocity when not facing the movement direction. Should fix monsters moving unnaturally when abruptly changing directions.
- Increased the swimming speeds of all monsters and adjusted the animations accordingly.
- Improved the path steering while swimming inside the submarine.
- Halved the swimming speeds inside the submarine.
- Increased the attack ranges for Hammerhead and Hammerhead gold to help them reach the targets.
- Don't allow large creatures like Bonethreshers or Hammerheads enter the submarine, because they easily get stuck and it's glitchy.
- Fixed characters that cannot enter the submarine still trying to target the inner walls.
- Fixed Tigerthresher and other creatures that can't attack the submarine bumping on the doors.
- Fixed characters occasionally getting stuck while trying to reach the last known position of the previous target.
- Fixed a crash when the creature is set to attack when provoked and when the damage source is null.
- Fixed extra creature being spawned when using the <monster> elements in the monster mission definitions.
- Fixed Hammerhead Matriarch's skirt going throught the walls.
- Fixed performance issues when creatures are trying to find a path out from the submarine while escaping. Also improved the escaping behavior in general.
- Fixed Mudraptors sometimes squeezing themselves towards doors without being able to attack them.
- Fixed monsters not reacting to being fired with turrets unless they can target the attacker.
- Fixed minor slipping in Mudraptor's walking animation.
- Weapons and tools now have ai targets that are only activated when the items are used -> shooting monsters should make you much more attractive target than just swimming peacefully around. 

Multiplayer:
- Fixed a bunch of bugs that caused "missing entity" errors. However, there are many different reasons the error can occur, so even though we have not run into the issue anymore during out testing rounds, there is still a chance it may occur in some situations.
- Fixed inventory items occasionally getting mixed up in the multiplayer campaign.
- Fixed a bug that caused clients to get disconnected with an "invalid object header" error when a character has a large amount of different afflictions.

- Fixed server owner occasionally timing out if loading the round takes too long.
- Fixed server owner's character occasionally being killed due to round start timeouts.
- Fixed players not getting notified in any way when their connection to the server has timed out, allowing them to keep playing without being able to interact with anything.
- Made giveperm/giverank commands suck less by allowing names, endpoints and SteamIDs instead of clientlist id, and allowing users to skip question prompt by adding rank or perm as a second parameter.
- Fixed multiplayer campaign saves appearing in the single player "load game" menu if they're placed in the singleplayer save folder (leading to a crash if a player starts to load the save).
- Fixed server not sending condition updates for inactive items, potentially causing the condition to get desynced when all of the components of the item go inactive.
- Fixed clients only being informed of the reason for their ban the moment they're banned, but not if they try to rejoin.
- Fixed clients not attempting to reconnect to the server automatically when the connection is lost, forcing the client to rejoin the server manually.
- Fixed clients sometimes being able to noclip through walls when the framerate or connection is poor.
- Karma system can be enabled/disabled in the "host server" menu.
- Option to set the number of password retries before a ban.
- Fixed voice chat indicators not working in the in-game crew list.
- Moved "End Round" button to the pause menu.
- Added a separate server log category for wiring.
- Fixed clients not relaying console commands that don't exist client-side to the server (i.e. custom commands implemented by a server mod can now be used by clients).
- Added "killdisconnectedtime" command that can be used to set the time after a disconnected player's character gets automatically killed.
- Increased default killdisconnectedtime to 2 minutes.
- Player cap can be adjusted in the server settings.
- Made "showseed" console command usable by clients.
- Fixed lobby command (which switches to the single player lobby) being usable in multiplayer.

Bugfixes:
- Fixes to render order oddities (structures with a depth > 0.5 always rendering behind all items, inconsistent render order between sub editor and in-game). Now structures with a depth of >= 0.9 are always behind everything (and visible through the LOS effect), and item's sprite depth is capped to 0.9.
- Fixed background structures that are resizeable on both axes always being drawn behind other background structures regardless of the sprite depth.
- Fixed Kastrull flooding when the drone undocks.
- Fixed ballast pumps deteriorating in Kastrull's drone despite being unreachable by the players.
- Fixed sonar transducers consuming no power.

- Fixed autopilot overshooting and compensating too heavily when attempting to maintain position, causing it to never fully stop on the target position.
- Fixed charactes being unable to get through multi-layer walls from inside the sub (for example the walls above Humpback's command room).
- Fixed plasma cutter not cutting through holes in walls.
- Fixed melee weapons not working inside ruins due to the colliders that block subs from entering the ruins.
- Fixed fabricator cancellation failing to be communicated under certain circumstances.
- Fixed fabricator and deconstructor operating faster when run on overvoltage, making it possible to fabricate/deconstruct things almost instantaneously by using relays.
- Fixed camera position "twitching" when moving the cursor around while unconscious.
- Fixed crashing if there's no audio device available.
- Fixed texts in mission/traitor notifications occasionally overflowing outside the border of the message box.
- Fixed subinventories not opening when trying to heal an unconscious character.
- Fixed engines causing crashes if MinVoltage is set to 0.
- Fixed small "twitch" when a character enters or exits a submarine.
- Fixed starting a combat mission with just 1 player counting as winning the mission.

- Fixed excessively large tonic liquid collider.
- Fixed accordion collider.
- Fixed doors not blocking hitscan weapons.
- Fixed sonar showing everything around the sub when sending out a directional ping and immediately switching to passive.
- Fixed inability to drag characters from room to another in alien ruins.
- Fixed crashing if a modded UI style contains multiple child styles with the same name.
- Fixed wire nodes getting misplaced when flipping wires in the sub editor.
- Fixed groups of items that include wires sometimes not getting placed at the position of the cursor when pasting them in the sub editor.
- Fixed currents heavily slowing down the submarine regardless of the force or direction of the current.
- Fixed some held items vibrating/twitching when moving.
- Fixed turrets emitting muzzle flash particles in an incorrect direction (the rotation of the particle was correct but the direction it flew towards not, which isn't noticeable with the non-moving vanilla particles).
- Fixed "skip tutorials" returning to the main menu instead of opening the correct tab when starting a new game.
- Fixed all items being highlighted in the multiplayer campaign store menu when another player buys something.
- Fixed setting the number of items to buy by typing a number in the text box being practically impossible in the multiplayer campaign store.
- Fixed grenades exploding multiple times if you throw one, pick it up before it explodes and rethrow it.
- Fixed bots occasionally letting go of ladders too soon when going to operate an item, causing them to fall down.
- Fixed some waypoint issues in Orca.
- Fixed wifi components in the respawn shuttle being able to communicate with the main sub in non-combat missions.
- Fixed engine sound range being up to 20 times larger than it should be.
- Fixed monsters occasionally being able to attack through walls.

- Fixed a couple of unfair ruin traps (rooms with coil/sensor placement that makes it impossible to pass through without getting zapped).
- Fixed mechanic tutorial getting softlocked if the player never has an oxygen tank (or aluminium) and sodium in their inventory at the same time. I.e. if they deconstruct the oxygen tanks first and put the aluminium in the fabricator, and then get the sodium and put it in the fabricator.

v0.9.6.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Networking/multiplayer fixes:
- Fixed the game occasionally freezing when joining a server.
- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused clients to disconnect with an "entity not found" error in the multiplayer. In technical terms, the issue occurred when the server spawned an entity with a given ID, sent a network event for that entity, and then spawned another entity that took up the ID of the previous entity. This could happen, for example, if in the multiplayer campaign a player happens to get an item with the same ID as an item in the inventory of another player who isn't currently present, and the other player joins the server. There are still most likely additional bugs that can cause similar error messages, so this fix will probably not get rid of the errors entirely.
- Fixed start button staying disabled in the server lobby when switching from the campaign mode to another game mode.
- Fixed clients occasionally getting disconnected due to the campaign store. Happened if a location had changed from one type to another (for example, natural formation to outpost), the players had bought something that wasn't originally available from the location and a new client joined.
- Fixed clients occasionally being prompted to download subs from the server even if they already have a matching sub.
- Fixed server having a password even if the password box is left empty in the in-game "host server" menu when hosting with the Linux version.
- Fixed server name being shortened to one word when hosting from the in-game "host server" menu with the Linux version.
- Fixed server name length not being restricted when set from serversettings.xml or using console commands.
- Fixed "ready to start" tickbox disappearing if a client joins while a round is running.
- Fixed traitors remaining as traitors client-side after restarting the round, allowing them to access the sabotage interface despite not having a traitor objective.
- Fixed characters occasionally not selecting/deselecting a periscope client-side, causing them to walk in place or not grab the periscope.
- Fixed male asian heads not appearing in the server lobby.
- Fixed campaign servers never being filtered out from the server browser when filtering based on game mode.
- Fixed clients not displaying the "could not connect" popup if the initial connection to a server times out.
- Fixed door weld state occasionally getting desynced, causing the door to be welded server-side but possible to open client-side.

Electricity fixes:
- Fixed junction boxes not passing signals to relays.
- Fixed broken junction boxes and relays carrying power.
- Fixed devices not receiving power if they're connected directly to batteries/supercapacitors with no relays or junction boxes in between.
- Fixed light components that receive power from somewhere else than a power input connection not going out when they lose power (e.g. lights on the diving suits).
- Fixed pumps and batteries operating/recharging faster when receiving overvoltage, with no upper limit, making it possible to for example operate pumps at 10x the speed by connecting them to a relay that's receiving 10x more power than is being drawn from it.
- Fixed LightComponents being toggled twice when they receive a signal to the toggle connection.

Misc fixes:
- Fixed "last used" listbox overlapping with the entity visibility tickboxes in the submarine editor on low resolutions. 
- Fixed misaligned colliders on the "Shell A Cap 0 deg A/B" wall pieces.
- Fixed links disappearing between linked subs and docking ports when loading in the sub editor.
- Fixed loading freezing for up to 10 seconds if the game cannot fetch the remote content for the main menu (update notifications, changelogs, etc).
- Fixed lights on devices (junction boxes, nav terminals, reactor) being rendered on top of characters.
- Fixed lights lagging a little behind moving objects (e.g. diving suit light).
- Fixed characters being able to grab/heal others when handcuffed.
- Character editor: don't switch to the limb mode when clicking a limb in the joint edit mode. Fixes difficulties in using the joint angle widgets when the widgets are interloping limb source rects.
- Character editor: Fixed the texture path field not being copied if the source character has no texture path defined. In this case, we can use a texture path found in one of the limbs.
- Fixed bots incorrectly reporting problems in the room they are in instead of the room the issues is spotted at.
- Fixed bots reporting broken devices or asking medical attendance even if they are taking care of those things.
- Fixed bots saying "put out a fire in hull" instead of using the name of the room when they extinguish a fire.
- Fixed AITargets staying active even if the entity is not active (for example, the sonar could still be heard by monsters after it's turned off).
- The bots now only report about issues that have not been already been reported.
- Fixed monsters attacking doors that are open.
- Monsters keep pursuing the target if the behavior is "pursue" even when they cannot attack.
- Bots stop operating devices if a player starts operating them (unless they have been ordered to operate the device).
- Fixed bots playing the rewiring sound when repairing an item with a screwdriver.
- Fixed bots sometimes stopping behind a closed door when trying to extinguish a fire.

- Fire extinguishers can't be placed inside toolboxes anymore.
- Fixed lobby screen not scaling correctly after changing to a bigger resolution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.5.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed crashing when attempting to start a tutorial.
- Fixed Kastrull's drone not being docked to the sub by default.
- Fixed items occasionally launching through walls/floors when they're spawned or dropped.
- Nerfed Hammerhead Spawns.
- Fixed occasional disconnections when the Hammerhead Matriarch releases her spawns.
- Fixed Hammerhead Matriarch exploding twice when it attacks.
- Fixed bots sometimes getting stuck in an objective loop, causing them to repeatedly drop and pick up diving suits or spam doors.
- Fixed bots being allowed to go outside without a diving suit.
- Fixed characters with a rectangular main collider being unable to use path finding.
- Fixed microphone volume scrollbar resetting to the maximum value when opening the settings menu.
- Fixed a bug that caused occasional crashes on Linux when pinging servers in the server list menu.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.5.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc additions and changes:
- A new submarine, Kastrull.
- 6 new traitor missions with much more varied objectives.
- More variants of all job outfits.
- 30 new character face sprites. 
- Overhauled job assignment logic to make the job distribution a little more balanced. Now each client gets assigned one of the spawnpoints (and its associated job) according to their job preference, which means that if the sub for example has 2x as many engineer spawnpoints than medic spawnpoints, there tend to be 2x more engineers. When playing with a mod that adds new jobs to the game, spawnpoints that have no job associated with them are considered spawnpoints for the non-vanilla jobs.
	- We would like to get feedback from players about this: does the job assignment seem fair, are people generally getting the jobs they want? 
- New logic components: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, modulo, round, ceil, floor and factorial.
- Improved autopilot: much faster and less likely to get stuck.
	- We would like to get feedback from players about this: Is there still incentive to steer manually?
- AI characters don't set stationary batteries to recharge unless ordered to do so.
- Items can be made damageable by projectiles, melee weapons and explosions by adding DamagedByProjectiles="true", DamagedByMeleeWeapons="true" or DamagedByExplosions="true" to the config.
- Nerfed welding fuel + diving mask combo. The tank depletes much faster and one tank is only enough to make the target fall unconscious, not to kill them.
- Added deconstruction recipes to all drugs.
- Added huskified face sprites to all characters.
- Question prompts in the debug console and dedicated server console (such as "enter the reason to ban XXX") can be cancelled by pressing Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z (or Ctrl+C in the in-game debug console).
- Welding tools and plasma cutters explode when loaded with the wrong fuel.
- Removed sodium as a product of recycling fire extinguishers.
- Added some loose vents and panels to Orca and Typhon.
- Option to set a name for a character added by a mod without having to configure it in a separate text file. Use displayname="somemonster" in the character element to set the name.
- Balanced splash screen audio volumes.
- Alarm buzzers twitch when active to make it more clear where the sound is coming from.
- Scrollbars that work as on/off switches (e.g. power switches and autotemp sliders in item interfaces) can be toggled by clicking on them.
- Decreased the chance of selecting a traitor mission that's already been selected during the session.

Multiplayer:
- Option to choose a "play style" for the servers to tell the players what kind of gameplay and rules they can expect on the server.
- Improved server browser:
	- More filtering options
		- Same version
		- Show whitelisted
		- Karma enabled
		- Traitors enabled
		- Friendly fire off
		- Voice chat enabled
		- Modded
	- Option to filter by play style.
	- Option to filter by game mode.
	- Added the option to favorite servers.
	- Added a list of recent servers.
	- Added a friends list, you can keep track on which servers your friends are playing at as well as join them directly from the friends list.
	- Miscellaneous layout improvements.
- Improved server lobby:
	- Improved character customization interface: players now have full control over their appearance.
	- Improved job preferences interface: players can now more easily switch around their class preferences, as well as pick which variation of an outfit they would like to wear.
	- Mission selection is more flexible: mission types can be toggled separately.
	- The campaign interface is displayed directly in the menu, not in a separate view.
	- The submarine preview is displayed directly in the menu without having to open a separate window.
	- The job preferences of other players are indicated in the player list.
	- Voice chat icon now indicates the loudness of the audio being transmitted/received.
	- Voice chat settings are indicated in the bottom-right corner of the chat box.
	- The server log is integrated into the chat box.
	- Added new server settings under anti-griefing tab which previously were only accessible through serversettings.xml.
		- Allow friendly fire.
		- Allow rewiring.
		- Allow disguises.
	- Miscellaneous layout changes.

Human AI:
- Changed the logic for automatically unequipping the diving gear, extinguishers or items that are held in hands.
- Taught the bots to place diving suits, fuel rods and fire extinguishers into right places, if they can't unequip the items without dropping them AND if the current objective is not high priority. The system uses tags/identifiers and two new attributes: "preferredcontainers" in Items and "containablerestrictions" in ItemComponents so it can be adjusted both in the editor and in xml.
- Improved the code to prevent dead-locks between the AI states.
- Start looking new oxygen when the current oxygen tank is at 10% instead of starting when it's empty (which often lead the bot to suffocate while doing the objective).
- Combat: Don't ignore empty weapons when evaluating weapons for the first time (allows to try reloading a weapon before ignoring it as useless).
- Fight Intruders: Automatically switch weapon when the current weapon runs out of ammo. Find ammunition for the current weapon if no other decent weapon is found. Don't allow to go offensive while armed with poor weapons, like a wrench.
- Fix Leaks: Improved the operating of welding tools.
- Rescue: Major refactoring. Allow to heal self. Improve the priority calculation. The priority is now based on the severity of wounds.
- Taught the bots to look deeper into the inventories (recursive) when seeking items.
- Changed the decision making on whether or not a bot needs diving gear.
- The bots now avoid unsafe paths in the idle state or when doing low priority objectives.
- The bots don't follow targets outside of the submarine.
- The bots don't stay still when idling underwater.They swim in place instead.
- Adjusted the combat priorities for the weapons.
- Increased the minimum initiatives.
- Adjusted the target evaluation for the Fix Leaks objective.
- Improved the distance approximations for all AI objectives.
- Increased the base devotion (how much the current objective priority is boosted).
- Reduced the shooting distance when the bots are operating turrets.
- Adjusted the idle waiting, standing, and walking times.
- Fixed bots getting stuck if the next node was behind a door.
- Fixed bots getting stuck on ladders when the main collider bottom was slightly lower than the floor level, even though the bot should be able to take off from the ladders.
- Fixed bots getting stuck on ladders when they need a new target while climbing.
- Fixed bots ignoring/avoiding targets in hulls when there were dead enemies inside them.
- Fixed issues in switching empty oxygen tanks to new.
- Fixed bots unequipping and re-equipping diving gear while ordered to follow another character.
- Fixed bots not being able to handle things when they cannot find diving gear. Now they should first try to get the gear and if it fails, they should just target a safe hull.
- Fixed bots shooting friendly characters with turrets.

- Fixed bots abandoning the operate item objective if there was another character operating the item.
- Fixed bots speaking about success/failure to repair when another character fixes their target.
- Fixed bots reporting individual failures when doing a loop objective. Should fix bots spamming with the "Cannot reach the target" msgs.
- Fixed the current objective not being reassigned after sorting the objectives, leading to sorting the subobjectives of the old current objective, which would be fixed only after the next time the objectives were sorted (after 1 sec).
- Fixed the gap size being misinterpreted when calculating the priority for a fix leak objective.
- Fixed bots switching repair targets while repairing an item.
- Fixed bots in some situations facing the wrong direction. The bots should now always face the item they are operating.
- Fixed bots' ragdolls getting unstable due to constant flipping in some rare cases.
- Fixed bots not immediately targeting the other rooms when they reach the airlock (when entering the submarine).

Monsters:
- New monster: Hammerhead Matriarch
- New monster: Hammerhead Spawn
- New diving suit sprite for husks.
- Characters now have a separate property that defines whether or not they can walk, meaning that characters can now enter the submarine even if they cannot walk. When there is no water, the character will fidget around.
Also fixes Fractal Guardians flying in non-flooded alien ruins.
- Monsters now remember the position of the last target even when idling. The memories fade, however.
- Monsters now flee briefly when being fired at with the turrets. Fixes swarming characters being easy to exploit.
- Don't allow the monsters to retaliate unless they are in the same submarine as the attacker. Removed the CanRetaliate parameter on character AI that was added in the previous update.

- Fixed targeting at wall center position instead of the section position. Fixes hammerheads and bonethreshers targeting destroyed wall sections.
- Fixed the damage modifiers on hammerheads not working properly.
- Fixed a crash when trying to create a swarm with characters that have no swarming behavior defined.
- Fixed monsters not targeting the closest limb when they should.
- Fixed ai targets not being updated when the character is dead, causing the characters to be too perceivable/not perceivable enough by the monsters.
- Fixed limbs' lightsources not being visible inside the submarine.
- Fixed immobilized characters (e.g. stunned, monsters on dry land) occasionally "hanging" mid-air.
- Fixed draw order issues due to normal sprites and deformable sprites being used on the same characters.

Character editor:
- Added "TailTorqueBoost" parameter that can be used to prevent long and fast-moving characters, like the Tigerthresher, to get tangled around themselves.
- "TailTorque" no longer affects the swimming sine amplitude (how strong the tail moves).
- Sprite orientation no longer affects the damage modifiers.
- Exposed the ragdoll main limb.
- Exposed the damage emitters.
- Exposed the damage sound of damage modifiers.
- The radial widget angles are now rounded to the closest 10.
- Fixed characters being able to collide with the submarine, which often caused large monsters to get stunned and impact sounds to be played when they're spawned.
- Fixed characters moving when they shouldn't.

Bugfixes:
- Rewrote power distribution logic to resolve several issues and oddities in the way power was distributed across electrical grids, particularly when relays were used. The new system is also less performance intensive, so submarines that had performance issues due to large and complex power grids should now run better.
- Fixed inability for mods to override jobs.
- Fixed pumps calculating targetlevel incorrectly when receiving a "set_targetlevel" signal, causing neutral ballast level value in the sub editor to be off.
- Fixed clients being able to join servers when they're using content packages the server doesn't have, which usually causes the client to get disconnected when a round starts.
- Fixed clients being able to join servers after enabling a required content package in the settings, even though they need to restart first (leading to errors when a round starts).
- Fixed "attempted to access a potentially removed character" console errors if a character dies while the client is waiting to apply the character's remote inventory state.
- Fixed broken waypoints in Typhon that prevented bots from opening some of the doors.
- Fixed characters being very hard or impossible to hit with melee weapons when they're lying on the floor.

- Fixed husk eggs not causing a husk infection when injected.
- Fixed depth sorting not working on damageable structures.
- Fixed characters stepping on nothing if their feet are below the lowest step of a ladder.
- Fixed door components being selectable when the door is broken, causing characters to drop from ladders if they interact with a door while climbing.

- Fixed dead characters still appearing in the crew list when a client joins mid-round.
- Fixes to decorative sprites: Rotation property is in degrees, fixed offset anim type being used as the rotation anim.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.4.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monster additions and changes:
- New character: Bonethresher.
- New character: Golden Hammerhead.
- Completely remade the Tigerthresher (new skin, ragdoll, behavior and attacks).
- Reworked Hammerhead (new ragdoll, adjusted behavior and attacks).
- Adjusted the behavior of most characters.
- Medium sized monsters can now more easily trigger impact effects when ramming the submarine.
- Characters are now allowed to move faster than previously (9 -> 15).
- Changed the mouth position calculations and redefined the values for all monsters that have the eating behavior.
- Removed Moloch Baby (Which was just a test. Molochs will be revisited later).
- Better bend deformations on limbs.
- Better feedback about hit impacts on limbs when the character takes damage.
- AI monsters should hit moving targets more easily.

Modding improvements:
- Mods can override specific content without having to create a completely new content package. This can
be done by surrounding the element with "<override></override>" (for example, an Item or a Character
config element you want to replace a vanilla Item/Character with). The overrides work based on identifiers;
for instance, if you configure an item with the identifier "wrench" and surround it with the override
tags, it will replace the vanilla wrench.
- Content package load order: the game will first load the core package, then other content in the order
 of selection (proper ui still pending). The load order is saved in the config_player.xml.
- Made AI orders and event manager settings moddable.
- The engine and reactor sound ranges can now be modified in the item XML.
- The husk affliction can now be modified and applied on any character.
- Support for multiple simultaneous husk afflictions based on the same system.
- Support for multiple husk appendages. Made the attachment limb configurable in the affliction definition.
- Additional content package validity checks during startup: make sure all XML files in the package can 
be loaded, and disable the package if they can't. Fixes tons of console errors on startup when a mod with 
invalid XML files is enabled.
- Don't allow publishing workshop items that contain invalid XML files.
- Don't allow selecting invalid content packages in the settings menu.
- Fixed disabled content packages becoming active when they're autoupdated.

drawn on the character.
- Exposed structure sound types.
- Exposed the mouth position.
- Exposed the angular damping and density for limbs (removed mass, which was not used).
- Added a default texture path for ragdolls so that the texture can only be defined once. Limb specific 
texture definitions override this.
- Allow to define a group for different species. The characters in the same group are friendly to each other.
- DecorativeSprites can now be used on character limbs (like on items).
- Made it easier to adjust the source rect's position with the arrows. Hold CTRL to change the size.

- Made level ambient lighting darker.
- Added "pause" console command (only usable in single player).

Bugfixes:
- Fixed crashing when the recharge speed of a PowerContainer with no interface (e.g. Alien Generator) is 
adjusted by a signal or a bot.
- Fixed docking interface becoming active on navigation terminals when any of the submarine's docking
ports are close to another docking port, even if the terminal in question is not wired to that port.
- Fixed an occasional crash when a bot starts retreating away from an enemy immediately after spawning.
- Fixed clients not creating a download prompt when a sub they don't have is selected by vote.
- Fixed traitor missions almost always placing the mission-related items inside the same containers.
- Fixed traitor goal durations being displayed as "duration(xx) seconds" instead of "xx seconds".
- Fixed Traitor's "find an item" objectives not being considered complete if the target item is inside 
another item within the traitor's inventory.
- Fixed server using the provided campaign savefile name as-is (without the required .save file extension) 
when starting a new campaign through the console. Caused clients to throw "File transfer failed (wrong 
file extension """!)" errors and prevented them from receiving the save files.
- Fixed servers being able to start the round multiple times by spamming the "start" console command 
before loading the round finishes.
- Fixed rewiring sound playing whenever a remote player is using a rewireable device.
- Fixed subinventories not opening when grabbing another character with no items in the corresponding slot.
- Fixed draggable inventories getting stuck to a half-open state if the item is equipped when

- Fixed spectators being distributed into teams in combat missions, potentially leading to imbalanced crew sizes.
- Notify the client using the "togglekarmatestmode" command about the test mode being enabled/disabled.
- Send karma change notifications when karma has changed by 1 unit or more when test mode is enabled, not 
just when an action causes an immediate change of 1 unit or more.
- Fixed adjacent sprites bleeding into the platform and topwindow sprites.
- Fixed autocompleting submarine/shuttle names when using the submarine/shuttle console commands.
- Fixed some items (like sonar beacon) attracting monsters even when they're powered off.
- Fixed inability to open the pause menu if an inventory slot had been highlighted when exiting 
the game screen.
- Fixed welded door sprites "twitching" when the submarine moves.
- Fixed crashing when a character with no hands or arms drops a holdable item.
- Non-humanoids (i.e. monsters controlled by a player) cannot be assigned as traitors.
- Traitor missions are considered unsuccessful if the objectives cannot be completed (for example if the
submarine doesn't have suitable containers to place the traitor items inside).
- Fixed the "Barotrauma" title text staying invisible in the main menu when coming back from the credits.
- Fixed clients not refreshing an item's editing hud when a remote player adjusts the values (i.e. if two 
players had selected the same lamp and one changed the color value, the other client wouldn't see 
the value change in the editing hud).
- Fixed a couple of the additive light sprites being slightly offset from the lamp.
- Clients don't display client-side vitality changes in healthbars until the actual vitality is received 
from the server. Fixes health occasionally dropping and then jumping back up if the client predicts damage 
incorrectly (e.g. if a melee attack hits client-side but doesn't server-side).
- Fixed character syncing being very inaccurate when switching to freecam and spectating a character
far away from other players.
- Fixed oxygen/fuel tanks attached to a tool being rendered behind the character's legs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.3.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the settings menu had been toggled open, which caused the client to start the round with an incorrect
submarine and get kicked out from the server due to entity ID mismatch errors.
- Added Japanese translation.
- Added Polish, Spanish and Turkish NPC conversations.
- Improvements to Russian and Spanish translations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.3.1

- Fixed "remove ban" and "range ban" buttons in the server settings menu doing nothing.
- Fixed switches occasionally getting desynced between clients.
- Added a tickbox for selecting/deselecting all permissions to the client management panel.
- Fixed clients with campaign management permissions not seeing the permissions of newly joined clients.
- Fixed statuseffects with a duration not having an effect on karma.
- Causing an "oxygen low" affliction decreases karma (for example when injecting large amounts of fentanyl).
- Fixed scroll values resetting in the multiplayer campaign store menu when purchasing/selling items.

Miscellaneous improvements:
- Attempting to drop an item to an empty inventory slot that's not of the right type (e.g. trying to put 
an extinguisher in the normal inventory slots), automatically moves the item to the correct slot if it's free.
- Made irrelevant items (light components, lamps, small automated pumps, etc) non-interactable in the tutorials.
- The first patient cannot be healed in the doctor tutorial until the "take the patient to the medbay" 
objective has been completed.

- Fixed inability to enable content packages created for a version prior to 0.9.2.0 (ones that have the 
content package in the Data/ContentPackages folder instead of in the mod folder).

icon caused some players to think the wall needs to be repaired with a wrench.
- Minor changes to the instruction texts in the mechanic tutorial.
- Reduced repair durations in the engineer/mechanic tutorials.
- Fixed draggable subinventories staying visible when stunned.
- Fixed light sprites not being scaled in the sub editor when resizing lamps.

- Fixed small creatures being unable to reach waypoints.
- Fixed bots getting stuck while trying to repair items (in practice hatches) while holding ladders.

- Added confirmation popups when exiting the sub editor or character editor to prevent losing unsaved work.
- Fixed reactor warning lights being clickable and becoming invisible when pressed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.2.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Karma improvements:
- Attacking someone who has just recently attacked you doesn't reduce karma.
- The karma penalty from attacking someone scales according to their karma (i.e. smaller penalty for

contains Chinese symbols for example.
- Fixed inability to enable/update content packages created for a version prior to 0.9.2.0 (ones that have 
the content package in the Data/ContentPackages folder instead of in the mod folder).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Easier server hosting:
- Switched to Steam's networking API, which allows clients to connect to servers without the need for the
host to forward their ports.

Expanded traitor feature:
- Multi-step traitor missions that not only make things more interesting to the traitors themselves but 
also to give the rest of the crew a fighting chance of detecting the traitor.

Anti-griefing:
- Karma: a system that detects malicious actions and automatically creates a more challenging experience 
for griefers, or potentially triggers a kickban. The feature is completely optional and the server hosts 
can decide how aggressively it will react to malicious actions. In a nutshell, you can lose karma for doing 
dumb things, karma is regained gradually over time and may be increased more rapidly by doing good things, 
thus negating false positives and also giving you the chance to redeem yourself. Lose too much karma and 
you'll start to experience increasing levels of inconvenience.
- Wire griefing is more difficult: wires have to be disconnected from the connection panels at both ends
before they can be removed. Disconnected wires can be seen visibly hanging from the device, with noticeable
particle effects and sound cues that make it easier to detect and fix wiring problems.
- Added a built-in overheat warning light and siren to reactors and increased the time it takes for the
reactor to catch fire and explode.
- Option to disable friendly fire altogether.

New items and structures:
- Additional weapons: stun gun, SMG, shotgun, grenade launcher, flamer, two new types of coilgun ammunition (piercing & explosive).
- New monster loot: husk stinger, mudraptor shell, crawler mask, moloch shell.
- Fun stuff: accordion, captain's pipe, toy hammer.
- Tons of new decorative submarine pieces for the sub editor.

New submarine:
- Berilia, a submarine for 16 players.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed crashing when selecting doors or gaps in the sub editor.
- Fixed crashing when combining items inside an ItemContainer (e.g. cabinet, deconstructor).
- Fixed shuttles not being able to redock into some submarines with unconventionally positioned docking 
ports. Specifically, if a port needed to be docked to from below but was positioned above the center of
the submarine (or vice versa), the docking interface would not activate on the navigation terminal.
- Fixed docking port using the wrong submarine's position for joint adjustment, causing errors when 
docking a submarine with greater mass to one with a smaller mass.
- Fixed an issue that caused occasional ID mismatch errors if a client died during a multiplayer
campaign round and disconnected before the round ended.
- Fixed item editing panel not appearing in wiring mode when selecting a wire in the sub editor.
- Fixed ability to throw throwable items while unconscious.
- Fixed bots not using fire extinguishers client-side in multiplayer.
- Fixed clients not hearing the sound when someone crowbars a door open.
- Fixed progress bars not showing client-side when cutting/welding doors.
- Fixed inability to combine items in multiplayer.
- Fixed occasional "index out of range" errors when loading walls that have been set to a non-default
scale in the submarine editor.
- Fixed inability to scroll the crew list with the mouse wheel when the cursor is over certain parts 
of the list.
- Fixed sonar pings stopping mid-way when active sonar is turned off, which could be exploited to stop
the pings before they reach a monster further away from the sub.
- Fixed clients not seeing other characters when entering spectator mode after their character has been
eaten by a creature.
- Fixed clients not seeing other characters in spectator mode after the distance between the submarine 
and the client's corpse gets great enough.
- Fixed clients getting stuck to a non-functional game screen if they start a new round before the ending 
cinematic has finished server-side.
- Fixed projectiles hitting a character you're standing next to when firing.
- Fixed characters automatically equipping handcuffs (i.e. handcuffing themselves) if they were picked up
when the only free inventory space was the hand slots.
- Fixed a rare race condition that occasionally caused the game to crash during the loading screen with 
a "no text packs available in English!" error message.
- Fixed husk infection being healable with broad-spectrum antibiotics even when the infection has reached 
the final stage.
- Fixed attachable items (detonators, electrical components) becoming deattachable without any tools 
if the sub is saved after deattaching them.
- Fixed projectile raycasts not taking wall rotation into account, causing the projectiles to hit sloped 
walls when standing next to them.
- Fixed PowerTransfer components checking overloads based on the item the recursive power check starts from, 
not the item that's currently being checked. Caused junction boxes to never break or catch fire in some subs
- Fixed crashing in the character editor when no textures were found for the selected character.
- Fixed crashing if a humanoid character has no knees or ankles.
- Fixed EventManager calculating flooding amount incorrectly, causing floods to only have a very small
effect on the intensity value.
- Fixed batteries and supercapacitors being able to provide power through their signal connections 
(e.g. "set_charge_rate", "charge_rate_out").
- Lighting fix: obstruct background lights behind hulls. Previously the background lights would only get 
obstructed by background structures, causing light to "bleed through" parts with no structures (e.g. 
humpback's docking port) and windows in the background walls.
- Fixed item loading being interrupted if any item XML cannot be loaded, causing some items not to be
loaded if any of the selected content packages are missing files or contain corrupted item XMLs.
- Fixed fire sounds not playing when standing inside a fire source.
- Fixed client names being converted to lower case when comparing them to the name written by the sender, 
preventing the message from being sent if the name wasn't written in lower case.
- Pass private messages to the client hosting the server when the message is targeted to the server.
- Private messages appear in the server log.
- Fixed plasma cutter and welding tool hit particles being offset from the flame.
- Fixed steel bar and titanium-aluminium alloy deconstructing to 100% condition items even when degraded 
(which could be used as an exploit to get infinite coilgun rounds).
- Fixed holdable items staying in the characters hand(s) when swapping them from a hand slot to another 
limb slot (for example, when moving a flashlight from a hand slot to the head slot).
- Fixed text wrapping not working properly with words that are longer than a single line.
- Fixed deconstructor losing some of the material from deconstructed items if the output container couldn't hold all of the new items.

- Fixed a crash when retrieving lobby information with an uninitialized IP.
- Fixed max player count in server list & duplicate lobby entries.

- Fixed inability to throw items through platforms.

Misc additions and changes:
- Respawn shuttles now spawn inside the level somewhere near the submarine, instead of always spawning
at the beginning of the level.
- Respawn shuttles don't leave and despawn until a new respawn is pending.
- Added "respawnnow" console command which immediately dispatches the respawn shuttle.
- Search for default animation/ragdoll folders from the folder where the character file is located, not
from "Content/Characters". Fixes mods not being able to load animation/ragdoll files if the file paths
are not defined explicitly in the character configuration file.
- Improved performance by deleting dead monsters that are far away from the sub and by disabling physics
on dead bodies when they stay still long enough.
- Added option to use conditionals to activate/deactivate ItemComponents. You can take a look at the 
reactor and junction box config files to see how it's used.
- Added some indicator lights to junction boxes and reactors.
- Stun batons don't affect large enemies (molochs, hammerheads, endworms, etc).
- In wiring mode, items are selected by pressing E instead of clicking. Selecting items with the left
mouse button made it very difficult to manipulate the wires because it was easy to accidentally select
some device instead of a wire node. 
- Crate/toolbox inventories stay open and can be moved across the screen when the item is equipped.
- Added limits to submarine name and description length.
- Delete incomplete file downloads when disconnecting from a server while a file transfer is active.

- Added widgets for manipulating coilgun/railgun rotation limits in the sub editor.
- Added a command for setting the value of a property on all selected entities in the sub editor 
(for example, "setentityproperties scale 2" would set the scale of all selected items/structures to 2).
- Show ballast tanks and airlocks in a different color on the status monitor to make it easier to 
distinguish which rooms are actually flooding and which are supposed to have water in them.
- Option to define multiple inventory variants for a character (e.g. to add variation to monster loot).
- Start playing the main menu music during the loading screen.
- More reliable human walk sounds (played at specific points of the walk cycle instead of relying on 
impacts between the feet and the floor).
- Option to show a 16x16 grid and snap the cursor to it in the sprite editor.
- Reactor can be controlled with movement keys.
- Option to add a probability for afflictions applied by an attack.
- Husk attacks have a 50% chance of causing a husk infection.
- Decreased minimum item scale from 0.1 to 0.01.
- The amount of materials received from deconstructing fuel rods depends on the condition of the fuel rod.
- Reactors keep sending the temperature_out signal after a meltdown.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:

- Toolboxes can be fabricated and decontructed.
- Nerfed nitroglycerin's structure damage and increased the impact tolerance from 4 to 6.
- Made alien pistols a little less underwhelming (sounds, recoil, particle effects).
- Deconstructors drop all items that are inside the deconstructed item. Previously they would just get destroyed, 
making it a potential exploit to destroy items that should not be possible to deconstruct.
- Modified welding fuel tank and oxygen tank sprites a bit to differentiate them from each other a bit more.
- Modified plasma cutter and welding tool sprites a bit to differentiate them from each other a bit more.
- Diving suits play the warning beep when there's no tank in the suit (not just when the tank is running out).

- Clients can change the server password using the command "setpassword" if they have a permission from the host.
- Reduced the range of the sonar ping sound and added a more subtle ping sound that can be heard further away.
- Watchmen now hold position when attacked.
- Added a subtle glow to alien buttons to make them a bit more noticeable.
- Items that are set to be hidden in-game can still be interacted with in the sub editor.

place it in the level. Caused large submarines sometimes to collide with walls when docked to outposts 
where the port is offset from the center.
- Fixed corrupted sub files causing crashes.
- Fixed item editing HUD not appearing on any other item after one item has been selected in-game 
(e.g. editing the channel on a wifi component prevented editing other items).

- Fixed deconstructing coilgun ammo boxes giving out more materials than the materials required to fabricate them.
- Scrollbars can only be dragged if the mouse button is pressed down while the cursor is on the scrollbar,
not by holding the button and moving it on the scrollbar. Fixes accidentally switching from slider 
to another (often happens in the reactor interface).
- Fixed crashing when setting limb or joint scale to 0 using console commands.
- Fixed dropdowns in the Workshop item publish menu being draw behind the buttons below them.
- Fixes bots being unable to exit ladders if some part of their body is below the platform.
- Ignore keyboard inputs (delete, arrow keys, copy/paste) in the sub editor when a textbox is selected.
Prevents accidentally deleting items/structures when attempting to delete text from a textbox.
- Toolboxes can't be put inside other toolboxes or in the doctor's clothes.
- Fixed items bought from the store during a singleplayer campaign session being deducted from the credits 
when save & quitting from the map.

usually with an error message warning about a missing item.
- Fixed players always getting range banned when banned by a client.
- Fixed turrets not being aimed correctly in multiplayer if they're in another sub (e.g. the coilgun in 
Remora's drone).

attempt to use the device at the same time and strange timing inconsistencies when deconstructing
multiple items in succession.
- Fixed all servers showing "unknown" as the game mode in the server list. 
- Fixed server not allowing forward slashes in host messages.
- Fixed repair interface sometimes getting stuck close to 100% in multiplayer.

Character editor fixes and improvements:
- Nicer layout, made the panels hideable.
- Added buttons for creating joints, duplicating limbs, and deleting limbs/joints.
- A dropdown for selecting which content package to add the character to.
- Allow creating a new content package during character creation.
- Added hotkeys 1, 2, 3 for limb, joint, and animation modes respectively.
- Change the logic of deciding on which parameters are shown and when. In the ragdoll mode you can now 
see the ragdoll, but also scale it and see the main parameters. Source rects are now longer shown on the 
sprite sheet if limbs mode is disabled.
- Automatically select edit limbs mode when a new character is created.
- Option to create multiple limbs in the character creation wizard.

v0.9.0.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- Made husks more common.

Multiplayer fixes:
- Fixed an ID mismatch problem that occasionally caused clients to get kicked out in the multiplayer 
campaign, usually with an error message warning about a missing item.
- Fixed servers using a local campaign save path sent by the client setupping the campaign, preventing
the campaign from starting up if the path does not exist at the server's end.
- Fixed radio communication occasionally not working between characters in the multiplayer campaign. Characters 
that had made it through at least one round were not able to communicate through radio with characters that 
have just been spawned for the first time.
- Kick votes persist during a multiplayer session even if the client disconnects (= disconnecting and rejoining 
just before you get kicked doesn't work anymore).
- The server sends a "this client previously used the name xxx" message when a client rejoins with a different name.
- Fixed GameServer.UnbanPlayer passing the name to BanList in lower case even though BanList was case 
sensitive (preventing unbanning clients with the "unban" command if their name is not in lower case).
- Fixed server not saving the whitelist when it's enabled/disabled, causing the setting to revert when 
relaunching the server.
- Fixed structure texture scale and texture offset now being reverting to default values when the 
submarine is saved by the server, causing them to reset between campaign rounds.
- Fixed client always launching the default "DedicatedServer.exe" even if using a content package that 
should replace the server exe.
- Servers only report content packages with files that cause multiplayer incompatibility to the master server. 
Fixes servers showing up as incompatible in the server list if they have custom sub files (or other types 
of files that don't cause compatibility issues) installed.
- Fixed crashing when clients attempted to kick/ban players through the in-game info menu when a round
was running.
- Fixed client that's hosting a server not being taken into account in the player count visible on the server list.
- Fixed server list not displaying non-English symbols correctly (e.g. Cyrillic or Chinese characters).

Misc fixes:
- Replaced WinForms with SDL which should resolve most of the fullscreen/resolution issues. It's also now
possible to change the resolution when in fullscreen without having to restart the game.
- Fixes to the DXGI crashes during startup.
- Fixed Character.GetConfigFile searching for the character file from all available content packages, not 
just the ones that are currently selected. Caused modded character files to affect the game even when 
the mod was not enabled, leading to various issues such as characters failing to equip items if the mod
changes the number or type of inventory slots a character has.
- Fixed a bug in monster/item spawnpoint logic that occasionally caused perfectly valid spawnpoints to be 
discarded when there were floating ice chunks in the level, sometimes causing monsters to spawn very
far from the submarine (which often lead to the player not running into them at all).
- Fixed bots not being able to retaliate when attacked with a repair tool.
- Fixed crashing when firing a revolver in the sub editor.
- Fixed items applying their status effects twice if they're put into a container by swapping them with
another item. For example, replacing a fuel rod in the reactor by dropping a new fuel rod on it caused
the reactor behave as if it had two rods in it.
- Switches send out a continuous 0/1 signal that can be flipped by interacting with the switch (as opposed 
to working like buttons which send out a pulse when interacted with).
- Fixed an issue that occasionally caused the main menu to look distorted when launching the game on Mac.
- Fixed crash after opening the file browser from the Workshop menu more than once on Linux.
- Fixed combat mission achievements being impossible to unlock.
- Fixed item scales not being saved when the scale is modified in the sub editor.
- Fixed incorrect physicorium shell description.
- Fixed server list & workshop menu not resizing properly when changing resolution.
- Fixed player input being used to determine whether a character should be holding on to ladders, causing 
AI characters to let go of ladders when holding RMB.

- Fixed OverrideSaveFolder and OverrideMultiplayerSaveFolder settings not being saved.
- Fixed order/rept icons "twitching" when the sub moves. or
- Fixed players being able to repair submerged electrical items indefinitely. 
- Fixed a "attempted to access a removed ragdoll" console error when a character wearing the health 
scanner HUD is removed.
- Fixed console errors when a battery's or supercapacitor's capacity is set to 0 and the interface is open.
- Fixed ability to drop items into secure lockers (or other containers that require specific items)
without having access to it.
- Automatically move the gaps linked to doors when the door is moved (and vice versa).
- Fixed items disappearing when they're dropped into a full container.
- Fixed crashing when an item that requires aim to use is used by something else than a character 
(e.g. a status effect).
- Fixed having a broken device on a sub in the sub editor and switching to Character Mode causing a crash.
- Fixed the bottom of the background ice texture not rendering correctly on high resolutions.

other jobs even when there's 3 or less players on the server).
- Increased default respawn transport time to 5 minutes, decreased respawn interval to 3 minutes.
- Allow muting players mid-round through the info menu.
- Allow to edit the door opening/closing speeds and increase the defaults.
- Reduce the follow-up distance and require the bot to be in the same room than the player before stopping, 
so that bots with a follow order don't stay on the doorways when the player is trying to enter the airlocks.
- Stop "breathing" deformations when the character is dead.
- Disable obstructed paths when the submarine docks to another submarine/outpost.
- The location of save files can be changed in config_player.xml using the attributes "overridesavefolder" 
and "overridemultiplayersavefolder".

- Added collision sounds to items (e.g. when dropping or throwing items on the floor).
- Devices that are not currently being used never deteriorate spontaneously.
- Added a new submarine, "Berilia".
- Minor improvements to menu layouts.
- Randomize map seed when opening the "new game" tab.
- Show the "starting a round" popup to all clients when the server initiates a new round.
- The CustomInterface ItemComponent can be used to trigger StatusEffects. Buttons apply OnUse effects when
pressed, tickboxes apply OnUse when checked and OnSecondaryUse when not.
- StatusEffects can modify item sound and sight ranges (requires an AITarget).
- Sonar beacons can be toggled on/off.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed submarines not being able to move horizontally in multiplayer if not accelerating fast enough.
- Fixed an inventory syncing issue that occasionally caused items to be dropped when moving them from the
inventory to a container or vice versa.
- Fixed items occasionally dropping from the inventory at a very high speed, sometimes causing them to
clip through floors.
- Fixed idling AI characters causing lag spikes if they can't find a path out of the room they're inside or
if the submarine has no waypoints.
- Fixes to AI characters getting stuck if they fail to reach a leak they're trying to repair.
- Fixed characters "selecting" equipped railgun shells and depth charges, causing the characters to face
towards the item.
- Prevent AI characters from jumping down from high places.
- Fixed highlighted items being selected when letting go of the Shoot button.
- Fixed inputs still working in multiplayer when the pause menu or the settings menu is open.
- Fixed some Steam achievements being impossible to unlock in single player.
- Fixed "Poisoner" Steam achievement being impossible to unlock.
- Fixed crashing when enabling game mode voting in multiplayer.
- Fixed voice chat volume not being applied on startup (i.e. the default volume was always used until you
went back to the settings menu to change it).
- Fixed power not working correctly in some grids with chained relays and junction boxes.
- Fixed crashing when attempting to publish a sub with a preview image larger than 1MB on the Steam Workshop.
- Don't allow overwriting vanilla submarines/characters even if the vanilla content package is not selected.
- Don't allow deleting vanilla subs or subs that are a part of some content package through the sub editor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.9
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- New control scheme: items are selected by left clicking, deselected with right click or esc, and held
items are used on devices by pressing E (e.g. when rewiring with a screwdriver or repairing something 
with a wrench). The new controls are somewhat experimental; the intention is to make them more intuitive
to new players. You can still switch back to the legacy control scheme from the game settings.
- Set default radio chat keybind to R and creature attack keybind to Mouse3.
- MODDERS, PLEASE NOTE: Moved crafting recipes from the fabricator xml to the xmls of the items. Makes it 
possible for modders to add new craftable items without having to modify the fabricators. 
- Some menu layout improvements.
- Camera movement is disabled completely when an item interface is open (not just when the cursor is on 
the interface).
- Option to disable the camera pan/zoom effects from the game settings.
- Option to set a custom preview image for subs.
- Allow aiming on ladders when not moving.
- Characters play Entrance of the Gladiators on the guitar when wearing a clown mask.
- Display a warning on the status monitor when docked to an outpost ("Docked to X, undock before attempting 
to maneuver the submarine").
- Improvements to the line of sight effect. Prevents ugly-looking artifacts in spots where two wall pieces
meet.
- The server gives the "None" permissions to new clients, allowing server hosts to automatically give 
specific permissions to all clients.
- Increased submarine masses to make it less easy for characters to push them around.
- Ping direction is shown on the sonar display when adjusting the direction slider even if directional ping 
is not enabled.
- Tweaked charybdis' AI, attacks and animations.
- Nuclear explosions cause radiation sickness.
- Reduced structure damage done by reactor explosions.
- Higher-resolution submarine preview images.
- Added a notification that tells where cargo spawns at the start of a round.
- Let the camera zoom out further when controlling a large monster.
- Added a longer delay to getting killed by pressure (5 seconds in max pressure).
- Made the pressure-zoom-in effect appear as soon as the pressure in a room starts to rise.
- Added blood particle effects when under high pressure.
- Some optimization to reduce loading times.
- Added a search bar to fabricators.
- Increased the range of docking port sounds and added a subtle camera shake when locking the ports to make 
it more noticeable when a sub docks.
- Made all new medical items fabricable.
- Automatically put the currently equipped item in the inventory (no matter if it's one or two handed) when 
picking up items that require two hands. 
- Job preferences can be edited mid-round in the info menu.
- Slightly reduced the amount of oxygen characters consume from hulls.
- Enemies don't attack outposts or targets inside it anymore.

Multiplayer fixes:
- Fixed characters retaining the last known inputs when a client disconnects, causing the character to
keep welding, honking a bike horn or whatever else they were doing until the server kills the character.
- More reliable throw StatusEffect (= grenade explosion) syncing. Fixes clients not seeing explosions
at their end.
- More reliable item wall attaching syncing. 
- Servers don't attempt to send position updates for items that have no enabled physics body (e.g. attached 
items). Fixes "received a position update for an item with no physics body" console errors when attaching
items to walls.
- Fixed spectate button staying visible when a round ends while a client is in the lobby.
- Fixed remote characters sliding slowly to the left client-side when standing in place.
- Fixed server creating "attempted to create a network event for an item that hasn't been fully initialized 
yet" console errors when spawning LightComponents mid-round.
- Fixes monsters flipping around way too often client-side (especially when inside the sub).

Bugfixes:
- Fixed wire connections that have been done mid-round not working properly. 
- Fixed crashing when attempting to speak as a monster in single player.
- Fixed linked subs not getting docked correctly when loading a saved game.
- Fixed turrets not working if they're placed inside the submarine.
- Fixed calyxanide not being usable in syringe guns.
- Explosive harpoons disappear after exploding.
- Emptying the "required items" field of an item in the sub editor now removes the item requirements (instead 
of using the default ones).
- Fixed crashing if a fabricator finishes creating an item after the user has been removed (e.g. eaten).
- Fixed crashing if none of the selected content packages contain location portraits suitable for the main menu.
- Fixed projectiles not applying status effects on impact if they have no attack defined.
- Fixed thorium rods not being usable in the reactor.
- Conditionals return a match when checking status tag inequality and the target has no status tags (e.g. 
checking if a character doesn't have a StatusEffect with a "poison" tag returns true even if the character 
has no active StatusEffects).
- Fixed severed limbs occasionally noclipping into the submarine.
- Fixed large engine emitting smoke before it becomes repairable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- Improved tutorial - better videos, instructional texts, objective list that suggest what you should do 
next, option to rewatch the videos and re-read the instructions.
- Overhauled charybdis (still a work in progress though).
- Automatically grab adjacent ladders when the top/bottom of the current ladder is reached. Makes moving 
through docking ports a little less confusing. 
- Option to configure when afflictions become visible with the health scanner by adding 
a "ShowInHealthScannerThreshold" attribute to the affliction.
- Added labels next to periscopes in Humpback and Dugong.
- Modified Humpback's bilge to make it easier for AI characters to fix.
- Enemies can now navigate out from the sub when escaping.
- Bunch of tweaks to monster AIs (targeting priorities, attack cooldowns, etc).
- Made InventoryIconColor and ContainerColor properties saveable.
- Removed descriptive name from alien artifacts (so be extra careful when bringing them on board).
- Allow panning the campaign map with WASD.
- Allow editing selected wires in wiring mode (so it's possible to, for example, modify the colors of
the wires without having to disconnect them).
- Decreased structure damage done by frag grenades and made them disappear after they've exploded.
- Batteries output charge values as integers.
- Made damaged junction boxes less sensitive to overvoltage. Nearly broken junction boxes were barely able 
to handle any overvoltage, leading to chain reaction where one junction box breaking causes the grid to be 
overloaded, and the rest of the boxes start taking damage at an increasing speed.
- Reactors don't cool down when underwater anymore.
- Removed minimum conditions from battery deconstruction output (= deconstructing an empty battery still 
gives the materials used to craft the battery).
- Made a bunch of ItemContainer UI panels larger.
- Items can be dragged and dropped directly from the inventory into containers without having to select 
the container first.
- Plants can be picked up from the environment without any tools.
- Added more help texts to highlighted items ("[E] Interact", "[E] Climb"...)

Multiplayer fixes:
- Changes to event syncing logic to prevent cases where clients fall behind the server and get kicked out
due to the server not being able to send out network events to the clients fast enough.
- Networking optimizations that prevent level objects and continuously deteriorating items from creating
excessive amounts of network events.
- Fixed windows clients being unable to start a campaign in servers running on Linux.
- Fixed clients being unable to start a campaign using a submarine that's not in the default Submarine
folder at the server's side.
- Fixed loading submarine files and campaign saves occasionally failing when running multiple instances
of the game from the same install location (for example, a dedicated server executable and a client 
executable).
- Don't transfer files through the network when sending them to the owner of the server (i.e. a client 
hosting directly from the main executable).
- Fixed fires and water occasionally getting out of sync between a client using the fire/water console
commands and the server.
- Fixed clients disconnecting with an "unknown object header" error if they fail to read a network event
(when they should instead report the error to the server and wait for a message that contains a more
descriptive error).
- Campaign fix: clear missions from locations that change their type, and all adjacent locations. Not 
clearing them caused missions to still be available when they logically shouldn't be (e.g. a transport 
mission from an uninhabited location to another) and syncing issues in multiplayer.
- Disable campaign start button if a round is already running when joining.
- Fixed clients being unable to end campaign rounds at all if the sub isn't at the start/end outpost 
(regardless if they have the permission to end the round or not).
- Fixed campaign characters still being displayed in the server lobby after the game mode has been 
changed to something else.
- Fixed items in the characters inventory always starting at 100% condition client-side even if they had 
deteriorated during the previous round.
- Fixed LevelResource (mineral, plant, etc) deattach timers not being synced with clients.
- AI characters can take out excess fuel rods from the reactor when needed.
- Item interfaces and the health interface can be closed with Esc.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed almost all items using default repair duration values (10 seconds with high skills, 100 seconds
with low skills) instead of the ones configured in the item XMLs.
- Nuclear shells and nuclear depth charges disappear after they've exploded. 
- Fixed "trying to add a dead character to crewmanager" errors when attempting to revive a character 
killed by some other affliction than internal damage, bleeding or burns.
- Take the position of a sub's docking port into account when determining where to place outposts.
Previously the outposts were simply placed midway between the adjacent walls, which occasionally caused
problems with submarines whose docking port is close to the bow or tail.
- Fixed a bug in relay components that caused a bunch of issues in power grids that utilize relays:
Relays would receive the full amount of power from the grid regardless of the load of the devices
connected to the power_out connection, causing unnecessary overloads and fires.
- Fixed batteries being able to draw power through relay components that are connected directly to 
a power source, even if the relay isn't on.
- Don't allow steering the sub with WASD when a textbox is selected.
- Use the SpriteColor of the item when drawing the moving parts of turrets and doors.
- Fixed steering issues that caused monsters to swim in an incorrect direction when they're targeting
something inside the sub.
- Fixed a crash due when scaling the Mudraptor.
- Fixed crashing if a character has neither a head angle or a torso angle configured.
- Fixed characters always being created in the default folder in the character editor.
- Monsters don't target doors/hatches at the exterior of the sub when inside or inner doors when outside.
- Don't display disabled limbs on sonar (i.e. severed limbs that have "faded out").
- Close the save/load dialogs when leaving the sub editor. Otherwise they'll still be visible when 
re-entering the editor, and saving at that point will overwrite the previously loaded sub with an empty one.
- Removing an item after it's been combined doesn't trigger the OnBroken StatusEffects (e.g. combining two 
half-full flash powder jars doesn't cause them to explode).
- Fixed welding tools and plasma cutters not hitting targets if the barrel is inside the target (e.g. if
trying to weld a completely broken wall with the cutter partially inside the wall).
- Fixed very small mineral colliders that made them extremely hard to hit with the plasma cutter.
- Fixed items with no sprite crashing the game (now they just cause a console error).
- Don't allow autointeracting with contained items (e.g. picking up an ammunition box from a loader) 
if another item is currently selected. Makes it less likely for players to accidentally pick up items 
from containers when they deselect another item.
- Fixed characters not letting go of the character they're grabbing when the health interface is closed
by clicking outside the window.
- Fixed CrewManager throwing errors if changing resolutions when a crew member is dead.
- Fixed items emitting light from inside containers in the sub editor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- The fission rate gauge on the reactor now visualizes the amount of fuel available.
- Doors and hatches can now also be repaired with wrenches.
- Changed default StatusEffect conditional comparison type back to OR.
- Clients communicate syncing errors to the server, and the server logs a more descriptive error about
what went wrong. Should make it easier to diagnose disconnection issues from now on.
- Ending a multiplayer campaign round by talking to watchman doesn't require any special permissions.
- Server automatically ends rounds if there have been no players alive in 60 seconds and respawning 
is not allowed during the round.
- Added a button for resetting an entity's properties to the default values to the sub editor.
- Updated handheld sonar UI graphics.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed non-radio chat/VOIP having an unlimited distance.
- Fixed a networking bug that caused the server to send item state changes to the clients before sending
a message about the item being spawned. For example, spawning any item with a LightComponent would always
cause clients to get disconnected.
- Changes to the way the clients are put in sync with the server when joining mid-round. Should make it 
less likely for clients to get disconnected immediately after starting a round.
- StatusEffects only apply non-limb-specific afflictions to one limb even if targeting the whole character. 
Fixes drugs like fentanyl and morphine being way too harmful due to the oxygen loss affliction being 
applied once per every limb. 
- Fixed TargetItemComponentName not working in StatusEffect conditionals (making it impossible to create
conditionals that target a specific component of an item).
- Made all of the new medical items combinable and usable in a syringe gun (assuming the drug is in a syringe).
- Fixed inability to throw anything in the multiplayer.
- Fixed multiplayer campaign setup UI showing the client's subs instead of the server's.
- Fixed campaign view button overlapping with the "ready to start" tickbox in the server lobby.
- Fixed sub/mode voting not being enabled when changing the setting after the server has been started.
- Fixed character inventories occasionally being saved incorrectly in the multiplayer campaign when an
- Fixed flares not activating by left clicking.
- Fixed affliction icons flickering rapidly in the health interface and above the health bar if their
strength is fluctuating around the threshold where the icon becomes visible.
- Fixed dedicated server crashing when typing in more text than can fit on one line. 
- Fixed enemies "fleeing" after they have been shot. There was a steering issue when they targeted characters 
inside the sub while being outside.
- Fixed Hammerhead attack causing warping.
- Fixed incorrect submarine and level seed in server logs when playing campaign mode.
- Hide the start button from the campaign UI if the client doesn't have the permission to manage 
the campaign or rounds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.6
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions:
- A major overhaul on the crew AI. They should now be much better at executing their tasks, keeping
themselves alive and less likely to get stuck.
- Re-enabled multiplayer campaign.
- New alien ruin art.
- New main menu (still a work in progress).
- New fonts.
- New subs and a new shuttle.
- New husk sprites.
- Improved item/character highlight effect.
- New signal items (divide, multiply, subtract, memory, equals, greater than, color, xor).
- Option to adjust microphone volume in multiplayer.
- Added a console commands for changing the gender and race of the character.
- More intuitive BrokenSprite condition logic: a BrokenSprite with a MaxCondition of 50 will start 
fading in at 50 (and be fully visible when the condition drops to 0 or down to the MaxCondition of 
the next BrokenSprite).
- Added Mirror X/Y buttons to editing HUDs and tooltips that tell about the keyboard shortcuts.

Multiplayer fixes:
- Improved item position syncing logic. Less warping or items being impossible to pick up due to
being in a different position server-side.
- Fixed clients not sending a network update to the server when dragging an item out of an inventory
slot, causing situations such as suffocation after dropping a diving suit due to the server not
knowing that you'd dropped it.
- The client hosting a server and spectators don't trigger autorestart.
- The owner of a server is allowed to spectate even if spectating is disallowed in server settings.
- Fixed "play yourself" always toggling to true when a round ends.
- Fixed missing item names in the extra cargo menu.
- Fixed traitor rounds failing to start if the server is not hosted by a client.
- Fixed console command aliases not being taken into account in GameClient.HasConsoleCommandPermission 
(meaning that the client needed a permission for each name variant of a command, making it impossible 
to for example use "fixwalls" instead of "fixhulls").
- Made the "control" console command usable to clients. 
- Show the "ready to start" tickbox in the server lobby even if the client has the permission to start 
the round.
- Fixed server lobby screen not showing the names of the submarines the client doesn't have.
- Fixed inability to select the respawn shuttle as a client host.
- Fixed VoipCapture creating new "could not start voice capture" popups constantly if there's no 
suitable capture device.
- Fixed crashing when starting a round if a submarine name contains underscores.
- Fixed clients console errors when attempting to modify the properties of an ItemComponent in-game
(for example, the color of a light component).
- Added some more information to the console messages and error popups when a client gets disconnected.
- Fixed enablecheats command crashing the server if it's used when there are no clients present.

Misc bugfixes:
- Audio fixes (less snap, crackle and pop).
- Fixed particle "jitter" when the submarine was moving fast.
- Fixed damage modifiers affecting all afflictions if they use affliction types instead of affliction 
identifiers. 
- Fixed end round vote text going outside the screen if there's a 2-digit amount of votes.
- Fixed StatusEffects only applying afflictions to one limb even if the target is "Character" instead of "Limb".
- Disable audio instead of crashing if no audio device is found.
- Fixed item interfaces getting repositioned every frame when the editing HUD is open.
- Fixed held items clipping with the sleeves of the character (e.g. when holding a revolver while an 
uniform is equipped).
- Fixed being able to levitate by spamming the ragdoll button.
- Fixed dead characters draining oxygen tanks inside diving suits/masks.
- Fixed reactor gauges getting messed up if the optimal fission rate is more than 100% (which may happen
if the power consumption is larger than what the reactor can generate).
- Fixed mud raptors not having an inventory (nor lootable items).
- Fixed inability to interact with any items when aim assist is set to 0%. 
- Fixed info panel flickering out and Tab getting "inverted" (= info panel shown when tab is not being held) 
when selecting crew members in the panel.
- Fixed characters arms occasionally getting stuck above their shoulders.
- Fixed wire nodes occasionally being created at the wrong end of a wire (e.g. when moving a wire between 
connections in a connection panel, the wire stretched from the device at the other end of the wire to 
the device that's being rewired).

Misc:
- Changed the way arguments are given to the "setclientcharacter" command (no semicolon to separate the 
names, quotation marks have to be used for multi-word names just like with any other command).
- Show the amount of credits in the crew tab of the campaign menu.
- Don't spawn new monsters if docked to the start outpost or within 50 meters of the start/end of the level.
- The diving knife now causes also internal damage besides bleeding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
- Fixed alien vents crashing the game when there's a character nearby.
- Fixed chatbox retaining the radio message prefix after being deselected.
- Push-to-talk doesn't trigger when typin in a text box.
- Fixed some server log messages and texts sent to clients being incorrect (= showing the tags that are
used to fetch the texts from the language files instead of the actual texts).
- Fixed AI orders that target a specific item (such as the order to power up the reactor) not working in
multiplayer.
- Fixed crashes when attempting to use voice capture or change voice capture settings when there are no 
suitable capture devices available.
- Fixed clients not being notified when an AI character shuts down the reactor.
- Fixed deconstructors staying active without power in multiplayer.
- Fixed sonar labels going outside the screen when at the left side of the display.

Additions & changes:
- Added some supplies to vanilla submarines.
- Balanced item deterioration rates and adjusted neutral ballast settings in vanilla subs.
- Increased the impact tolerance of crawlers to prevent them from killing themselves by bumping into walls.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiplayer improvements:
- Got rid of the listen server: when hosting as a client, the game actually runs the dedicated server executable
in the background. Makes client-hosted servers a little smoother due to the better performance of the dedicated
server, and also makes it much easier for us to maintain and test the multiplayer because we no longer have
two separate server applications.
- Added multiplayer campaign.
- VOIP support! Still a work in progress, so minor audio glitches are to be expected.
- Improved character and submarine position syncing. Way less rubberbanding and teleporting!
- Fixed servers occasionally starting the round multiple times when autorestarting or starting by voting.
- Fixes players being unable to log in as a client when they're hosting a dedicated server on another machine.
- Option to randomize your job preferences in the server lobby.
- Fixed a server timing issue that occasionally caused the server to kick clients due to desync when a round starts.
- Fixed occasional server-side "maximum packet size exceeded" errors.
- Require the players to either dock with the ending outpost or to get the sub close and enter the outpost before 
automatically ending the round.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed crashing if the round ends while the health window is open.
- Fixed incorrect item panel positioning in the crew command interface when the sub is docked to something. 
- Fixed crashing when an incompatible content package is selected in config.xml or if the content package 
cannot be found.
- Fixed screen distortion effects on Linux.
- Fixed non-character key input on Linux (arrow keys, tab, etc).
- Fixed fullscreen option not taking effect on game launch.
- Fixes to a bunch of crashes in the character editor.
- Fixed subinventories not being displayed on the inner clothes slot, making it impossible to use the extra
slots in uniforms.
- Fixed game settings resetting every time the game is updated.
- Fixed bots shooting at their own crew with turrets.
- Fixed wifi components not receiving chat messages in single player.
- Fixed AI not reloading coilguns if an empty box of ammunition is inserted in the loader.
- Fixed incorrect deusizine scale.
- Fixed turret light toggle not doing anything.
- Fixed character skills that aren't defined in the job xml never increasing, resulting in all jobs except 
the captain always having a helm skill of 0.
- Fixed flashlight & scooter light cones being "clipped".
- Fixed StatusEffects bypassing limb damage modifiers.
- Fixed waypoints not getting connected between docking ports on some subs.
- Fixed target identifiers being bypassed when a StatusEffect is set to target nearby items or characters.
- Fixed the "insufficient skills to use the item" text popping up if a character doesn't have sufficient 
skills to operate one of the item's components, even if the component was not interacted with (e.g. captains 
got a warning about not being able to use the connection panel of a nav terminal, even if they didn't select 
the connection panel).

Steam Workshop:
- Update installed workshop items automatically on startup.
- Allow adding submarines to workshop items with the "add file" dialog.
- If creating an update for a workshop item that's currently installed, use the installed version instead 
of the one downloaded from the workshop.

Additions:
- Some new random events.
- A bunch of new afflictions and medical items.
- Some new item sprites.
- A couple of new cargo missions.
- Added some new items that can be crafted from alien materials.
- Display linked hulls as one room on the status monitor.
- Tons of new sound effects.
- Display the controlled character in the crew interface.
- Option to "give orders" to the character you're controlling. In single player it can be useful if you want 
the controlled character to keep doing something when switching to another one, in the multiplayer it can be 
used to let others know what you're doing.
- Added a weak spot to Moloch's bladder.
- Baby Moloch, doo doo doo doo doo doo 
- Added damage particles to Mud Raptors and Molochs.
- Added "minimum velocity" property to to motion sensors. Allows making sensors that, for example, keep a door open 
when a character is standing in the doorway.
- Option to choose whether to use AND/OR logic in StatusEffects with multiple conditionals. Defaults to AND.
- Added a 1 second "cooldown" to water detector state switches to prevent alarms from toggling on and off constantly 
when the water level is fluctuating around the position of the detector.
- Added scram option (reactor shutdown) to the nav consoles in the vanilla subs.
- Support for binding Mouse4, Mouse5 and MouseWheel.
- Made Hammerhead and Mudraptor attracted to light. 
- New husk sprite (still WIP).

Misc:
- Decreased deterioration rates across the board. Repairing a damaged item to full condition also now resets
the deterioration delay, meaning that the item will not start deteriorating again immediately after it's been
repaired.
- Miscellaneous optimization.
- Removed the info button from the top-left corner - the info menu is now opened with TAB.
- Changed default chat/radio keybinds to T and Y.
- Welding tools repair all the walls within the range of the raycast, not just the first wall the raycast hits. 
Makes it easier to repair overlapping and multi-layered walls.
- Decreased the range of passive sonar - previously there was often no reason to use the active sonar because
the passive mode showed the area around the sub so clearly.
- Health scanner shows all active afflictions (not just those that are visible in the health interface). 
Allows detecting afflictions at an earlier stage, making the item much more useful.
- Nerfed the structure damage done by Molochs and Crawlers.
- Reduced creature HP across the board.
- Increased the amount of minerals in levels.
- Increased flare burn time, making them more useful as path markers during exploration of ruins.
- RepairTool damage is configured using StatusEffects and Afflictions instead of the "limbfixamount" attribute 
that always does burn damage.
- Made headsets craftable.
- Battery output doesn't start dropping until the charge is below 10%.
- Restrict the amount of power going through relay components to the MaxPower value of the relay.
- Set Humpback reactor output a bit higher, batteries now start at full charge and relays can't be overloaded.
- Miscellaneous fixes and balancing to vanilla subs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed AI-controlled husk not spawning when a huskified player dies.
- Fixed AI crew occasionally going outside to fix leaks.
- Fixed server failing to sync clients who join the server after a character has been removed during 
the round (e.g. eaten, turned into a husk).
- Fixed server-side console errors when clients attempt to use a fabricator.
- Display Steam authentication errors in the server logs.
- Fixed status effects with a ReduceAffliction value of 0 freezing the game.
- Fixed sliders not moving in the battery/supercapacitor interface when an AI character is operating it.
- Fixed chatbox being deselected in the net lobby when receiving a lobby update from the server (i.e. 
whenever the server host changes any setting).
- Fixed OnBroken status effects firing in the submarine editor when an item's condition is set to zero
(for example, reactors exploding and breaking all the nearby walls).
- Fixed file number being added to the file extension of debug console log files ("file123.txt (2)" 
instead of "file123 (2).txt").
- Fixed battery positioning in charging docks.
- Fixed crashing when ending a single player round while a character is outside the sub.
- Fixed "attempting to remove an already removed item" console errors when ending a round.
- Fixed fire sounds persisting in menus.
- Fixed the layout of the extra cargo menu in server settings.
- Fixed depth charges disappearing from loaders when interacting them with both hand slots full.
- Fixed StatusEffects not being able to target item components. Caused doors to be impossible to weld 
and most likely other issues with item StatusEffects as well. 
- Artifacts spawn in artifact holders again.
- Fixes to "attempted to move pulljoint extremely far" errors which occasionally caused severe problems
in syncing characters' positions.
- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused monsters to spawn very close to the submarine in monster missions.
- Fixed servers occasionally starting the round multiple times when automatically starting the game via 
autorestart or clients being ready. 
- Fixed up-to-date content packages being reported as incompatible in the Steam workshop menu.
- Changed the default radio chat hotkey to T.
- Fixed the line of sight effect not working on ruins when looking at them from inside a sub.
- Fixed fabricator allowing new items to be created when the output is not empty, resulting in wasted materials.

v0.8.9.1 (closed alpha)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Too many changes to list here. :) We've been working on this update for a year now, with a team of about 
a dozen people (as opposed to a couple of devs working on it on their free time).

Almost every aspect of the game has been improved to some extent - some polished a bit, some went through 
a more major overhaul and many things are completely new.

This is by no means a complete list, but here's some of the new things:

- A full graphics overhaul: almost all of the sprites has been polished or completely remade.
- Improved random event system that tries to keep the overall difficulty of the game at certain level,
delaying additional monster spawns if there's already lots of things going on, or spawning more when 
there's a more quiet moment.
- Improved difficulty system: now the difficulty level has a much more noticeable effect on the gameplay.
- General difficulty balancing all across the board: we've tried to make the difficulty curve more approachable
to new players while still keeping things challenging for more experienced players on higher difficulty levels.
- More varied levels, environmental hazards.
- A new more detailed health system with things such as limb-specific injuries, addictions, overdoses, 
mental issues... The system is also highly moddable, and makes it much easier to implement things such as
hunger mechanics, more varied poisons or stat-boosting items.
- Completely redesigned in-game HUD (the inventory, crew command interface, chat, etc).
- Redesigned crafting system.
- Minerals scattered across the level (can be used for crafting).
- A command/report system that can be used to communicate with your crew more effectively (in both single 
player and multiplayer).
- Tons of additions to alien ruins (traps, puzzles, non-flooded rooms).
- Improved AI (both the crew AI and the enemy AIs).
- NPC dialog (including random chatter and context-specific lines that make it easier to keep track of 
what the crew is doing).
- Most of the device interfaces have been redesigned to make them easier to use (and nicer to look at!).
- Many additions to the campaign mode (still a work in progress though).
- Overhauled the skill system: now every character can generally do anything (repair devices, fabricate 
new items, apply medical treatments), but characters with higher skill levels will do things more efficiently.
- Skill progression in the campaign mode: characters' skills gradually increase, making them more valuable with 
each completed round.
- New music composed specifically for the game.
- Overhauled audio.
- New monsters.
- New items (weapons, tools, medical items, alien items, crafting materials, etc).
- A completely remade tutorial.
- Too many bugfixes to count.
- Improved and much more stable ragdoll animations.
- Additional tools for modders (character editor, sprite editor, level editor, additions to the submarine editor).
- Steam functionality of course: full Workshop support, achievements, banning Steam IDs from servers...
- Improved translation support: it's possible to translate texts in item/job/etc configuration files without
breaking compatibility with existing subs or mods (see the EnglishVanilla file for some instructions).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed clients not seeing explosions from items that explode on impact or when their condition reaches zero.

- Docking ports automatically stretch the hulls between them to cover the area between the docked subs. 
Otherwise there may be areas uncovered by hulls if the docking port is positioned slightly outside the 
extents of the submarine's hulls, causing characters to implode or get thrown back when they try to pass 
from sub to another.
- Fixed client-side docking ports creating duplicate bodies on doors, causing characters to collide with 
an invisible door when trying to move between docked subs (until the server forces them through it).

docked subs.
- Fixed status effects that deplete oxygen affecting characters that don't need air to breathe.
- More error logging to diagnose syncing errors.

- Hitscan weapons like the revolver can hit targets outside the sub when firing from the inside and 
vice versa.
- Fixed crashing when attempting to clone linked submarines in the sub editor.

- Added a submarine preview window that displays a preview image and some extra information of the subs.
- Option to configure which content packages a submarine is compatible with.
- Names and health bars fade out when the cursor is not being hovered near the character.
- Added spark and smoke particle effects when welding or cutting something.
- Welding or cutting a door displays its health.
- Added a button for forcing the controlled character into ragdoll mode.
- Option to grab onto the torso of a dead/unconscious character.
- Dead/unconscious characters can be dragged up ladders.
- Improved CPR animations.
- Doing CPR on bleeding characters causes them to take damage.
- Characters can fall through holes in floors.
- Players can pick up corpses and eat them when controlling a monster.
- Husks don't attack huskified humans.
- Characters with severed limbs cannot be resurrected as a husk.
- The humanhusk.xml config file is found based on the name instead of the file path, making it possible
to use a custom config file without modifying the original one.
- More footstep sound variety.
- More gore particles!
- Added a conditional system to status effects. Allows creating status effects that only have an effect
when a specific condition is met (e.g. health above a specific level, charge of an item high enough).
- Option to prevent status effects from stacking.
- Option to make status effects cancel other status effects.

Items:
	- Added syringe guns and a bunch of new chemicals.
	- Added ducts, switches and motion detectors.
	- Added crowbars (can be used to open locked doors).
	- Chemicals and explosives can be thrown.
	- Made more items craftable and deconstructable.
	- Added sprites for broken doors, hatches and junction boxes.
	- Health Scanner HUD displays causes of death.
	- Health Scanner HUD only shows the status of the visible character that the cursor is closest to 
	prevent multiple characters from cluttering the screen
	- Added "smallitem" tag to revolver rounds (can be placed in cabinets and pockets now).
	- Option to determine which types of targets a projectile can stick to.
	- Improved revolver hitscan logic.
	- Item descriptions can be changed in the submarine editor.
	- Characters can hold flashlights in their mouths.
	- Added an inventory slot for ID cards.
	- If a character is wearing an item that obscures their face, the game will either hide their name or
	show the name that's in the ID card the character is wearing. 
	- The owner of an ID card is stated in the description of the card.
	- Fabricating items requires the ingredients to have a specific minimum condition (can't use 
	already-used consumables to craft something).
	- Deconstructing an item that's not in a full condition may prevent some deconstruction products from appearing.
	- Optimized electricity/signal logic.
	- Grenades can be triggered by detonators.
	- Bought cargo spawns in containers instead of being scattered across the floor.
	- Players can't use other items when a railgun controller is selected. Prevents accidentally firing 
	weapons or hitting people with something while using the railguns.
	- Item editing menus display color values as 0-255 instead of 0-1.
	- Reactor temperature has to be critical for 30 seconds before the reactor explodes, giving the crew 
	more time to deal with griefers or incompetent reactor operators. The reactors also have an output 
	connection	that sends out a signal when the temperature is critical.

Multiplayer additions:
	- Added an optional "karma system". Harming other players, damaging structures and blowing up the reactor 
	reduces karma, while repairing things causes it to increase. A too low karma level prevents the players 
	from choosing specific jobs
	- Clients can be given permission to use specific console commands.
	- Client permission presets: the clients can be assigned as moderators or admins which have specific
	pre-configured permissions. New presets can be added by editing Data/permissionpresets.xml.

	secretly identify other traitors.
	- Added an option to make players spawn directly in the main submarine instead of the respawn shuttle.
	- Keybinds are disabled when the chatbox is active. Now it's possible to use normal letter/number keys
	as the chat hotkey without accidentally deselecting the chatbox by typing a message.
	- Chat hotkey can also be used in the server lobby.
	- Added a [PM] tag to private chat messages.
	- Fixed game over/round end music not playing when a round ends.
	- Cutting and repairing walls is included in server logs.

Multiplayer bugfixes:
	- Fixed clients getting disconnected due to desync when a new monster is spawned mid-round by 
	a repeating	monster event.
	- Fixed modified clients being able to chat while unconscious due to the lack of server-side checks.
	- Fixed modified clients being able to disconnect locked wires due to the lack of server-side checks.
	- Fixed chat messages being assigned to the wrong sender when their bodies have been eaten.
	- Fixed crashing when setting a server filter while the game is refreshing the server list.

	to their inventory first.
	- Fixed 5th server being impossible to select in the server list.
	- Improvements to character position syncing.
	- Re-enabled logic for preventing players from using visually similar names.
	- Fixed client-side null exception when the client is in the lobby and a round ends with the mission 
	successfully completed.
	- Fixed clients being able to votekick/kick/ban themselves in the server lobby.
	- Fixed "selected mode" and "mission type" settings not being saved.
	- Level seed randomization can be toggled on and off via the debug console.
	- Fixed dedicated server not randomizing the submarine or game mode even if randomization is enabled.

	- Fixed wire nodes being impossible to select in the wiring mode if the nodes are exactly at the same position.
	- Fixed artifact holders being occasionally placed inside ruin doors and hatches.
	- Fixed particles in water being drawn under ruin structures, making it seem as if plasma cutters and
	welders weren't working.
	- Fixed all ruin structures having a health of 100.
	- Fixed OnActive status effects not being applied on powered items that don't require any power.
	- Fixed damage modifiers being applied multiple times when wearing an item that takes up multiple slots.
	Meaning that items such as the diving suit gave the players an excessive protection against damage.
	- Messagebox overflow fixes.
	- Fixed status effects not being able to decrease stun timers.
	- Fixed anti-husk medicine being able to reduce husk infection state after the infection has reached
	the active state.
	- Fixed monsters being able to spawn right next to the spawnpoint of the sub.
	- Fixed hulls not being linked to gaps if the center of the gap is exactly at the edge of the adjacent
	hulls.
	- Miscellaneous crew AI fixes.
	- Fixes to fast projectiles going through walls.
	- Fixed structure damage sounds not being played when a structure is fully destroyed.
	- Fixed glass windows using wrong sound effects.
	- Fixed carrier's light falling off when it dies.
	- Fixed incorrect positioning of debug console question prompts.
	- Fixed being able to use a wrench on multiple items at the same time.
	- Fixed double-clicking items in corpses putting them in their hands instead of your own inventory.
	- Fixed some level seeds generating a tiny enclosed cave that makes it impossible to reach the destination.
	- Fixed opened and broken doors being ignored during waypoint generation, causing waypoint connections 
	to go through doors which prevented AI characters from opening them.

	- Fixed modified wall colors only being visible in the submarine editor.
	- Fixed items being dropped when attempting to place them in an itemcontainer slot that's on a normal 
	inventory slot.

	- Fixed submarine editor crashing when attempting to use illegal characters in the filename.
	- Mouse clicks have to be <10 pixels apart to be considered a double click.
	- Fixed subinventory slots going outside the screen when highlighting an item such as a metal crate.
	- All creatures all cleared from the tutorial level to prevent any unintended monster attacks.
	- Fixed "constructing final path failed" pathfinding errors.
	- Fixed particles going through closed gaps (e.g. closed doors).
	- Fixed submarines being able to enter ruins.
	- Fixed collisions between a sub and the ruins not causing any damage to either the sub or the ruins.
	- Whitespace is ignored when calculating MD5 hashes for files.

v0.7.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added console commands for modifying client permissions.
- Fixed content package setting not being saved in the settings menu.
- Item pickup sounds are only played when the controlled character picks up an item.
- Removed serverconfig.xml (the dedicated server now uses the same config file as the normal game).
- Updated the vanilla content package to version 0.7.
- Fixed entity linking in the submarine editor.
- Fixed railgun HUD crashing the game if the railgun is linked to an item that does not have an 
ItemContainer component (i.e. any item that can't contain other items).

- Fixed crashes when attempting to use a railgun controller that's not connected to anything.
- Fixed autorestart counter overlapping with the campaign map in the server lobby screen.
- Fixed characters receiving damage almost exclusively to their feet when wearing a diving suit.
- Armoring reduces damage by a certain percentage, not a fixed value. Now armor doesn't make characters
invulnerable to small amounts of damage.
- The effectiveness of different types of armor depends on the type of damage. For example, diving suits
provide fairly good protection against burn and slash damage, but aren't as affective against blunt damage.
- Fixed light sources attached to limbs not rotating with the limbs.

	- Minor particle optimizations.

Bugfixes:
	- Fixed the "DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED" crashes on specific GPUs when the loading reaches 80%.
	- Fixed crashes when projectiles stuck to items on dedicated server.

	a character turns into a husk).
	- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused swimming creatures to flip around constantly.
	- Fixed a bug that caused creatures to be able to sever limb joints that shouldn't be possible to sever,
	causing issues when attempting to sync the positions of the dead bodies.
	- Fixed vote count texts persisting in the server lobby after the host disables voting.
	- Fixed newly joined clients not receiving the latest voting status until someone votes for something.
	- Fixed vote count texts not being updated after a client disconnects and their vote is removed.

	- Fixed AI characters never making any sounds in multiplayer.
	- Fixed inability to rebind keys to Mouse2 via the settings menu.
	- Fixed destroyed doors being impossible to repair.
	- Fixed creatures seeking towards an incorrect position when trying to eat something (causing larger 
	creatures like threshers and coelanths to swim around the target without ever reaching it).

Items:

	- Sounds for picking up and dropping items.
	- Medical scanner displays husk infections.
	- New C4, detonator and grenade sprites.
	- Optimizations and minor visual changes to the sonar display.
	- Support for hitscan projectiles.
	- Fixed ranged weapons launching projectiles with an incorrect rotation.
	- The spread of ranged weapons can be adjusted (separate values for normal spread and spread when 
	the item is being used by a character with an inadequate skill level).
	- Heavier harpoon gun recoil and impulse when the spear hits something.

- Improved item editing UI:
	- Number input fields for numeric values.
	- Separate number input fields for the components of vector values (instead of one text input box)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.6.1.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Plasma cutters can cut alien ruins again.
- Fixed reactors staying operational after the fuel rods run out.
- Fixed spawning items at the cursor via the debug console.

- The server log menu remembers the state of the filters when toggling it.
- Fixed level generation errors in some specific seeds that caused the game to create ruin walls with
a negative width/height (example seed: cBLgZ2im).
- Fixed a submarine position syncing issue that caused erratic physics behavior on some specific 
multi-part subs, because the game only moved one part of the sub and the parts docked to it, not taking
into account that more parts may be docked to the docked parts.
- Handcuffed AI characters can't climb ladders.
- Fixed crashing when a huskified human is killed by an explosion.
- Added some GPU info to the crash reports and extra debug logging to hopefully diagnose the 
SharpDXExceptions during startup.

v0.6.1.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed hulls not being rendered in the submarine editor.
- Crouching is synced between the server and the clients.

v0.6.1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed diving suits and masks not providing enough oxygen when in a low-oxygen room or outside the submarine.
- Fixed message boxes being impossible to close in the launcher.

Misc:
	- Improved item interaction logic: highlighting items is more precise, with items directly under 
	the cursor taking priority.
	- Characters can be dismembered by creatures and explosions.
	- New blood particles.
	- Blood, explosion and fire decals.
	- Added an artifact that attracts creatures.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Readded spam filter.
- Servers log the automatic temperature control setting of nuclear reactors.
- If a client fails to start a round (due to a missing sub file or an error, for example), their character

	hide from enemies.
	- new sonar visuals
	- texts in labels can be resized
	- alien weapons can be used as railgun ammo
	- nerfed oxygen and welding fuel tank explosions

	- Submarine files can be "merged", i.e. submarines can consist of multiple separate parts which can
	be docked into each other
	- the multiplayer mode has a "respawn shuttle" which transports respawned players from the entrance
	to the main submarine
	- parts of the submarine and characters inside them can be left behind in the single player mode
	(and later salvaged if you wish to do so)

Multiplayer:
	- fixed a bunch of bugs that caused entity IDs not to match between the clients and the server (which
	caused severe syncing issues)

	(custom subs may need some modifications to get the top speeds of the smaller/larger subs back to a
	steerable level)

	damage (i.e. submarines with thicker walls and no windows can go deeper)

Misc:
	- stunned characters can't move items in their inventory
	- characters can run while grabbing/dragging someone
	- fixed a bug that made it impossible to spawn characters through the console in the Linux version
